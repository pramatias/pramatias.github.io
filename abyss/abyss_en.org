* Meeting with the unknown
[[./img/abyss.png]]

The abyss, a term often used to describe the depths of despair and hopelessness, has become a buzzword in recent years. It has been romanticized in literature and media, with some even going so far as to claim that staring into the abyss is a necessary step on the path to enlightenment. However, I must say that I find this trend to be nothing more than hype.

To be clear, I am not denying the existence of the abyss or the fact that it can be a difficult and terrifying place to find oneself. However, the idea that one must actively seek out the abyss or pay exorbitant prices to experience it is simply absurd. The abyss is not some exclusive club or a tourist destination that can be visited for entertainment. It is a state of being that can arise at any moment, often unexpectedly and without warning.

Furthermore, the notion that the abyss holds some sort of inherent value or wisdom is highly questionable. While it is true that facing difficult challenges and overcoming adversity can lead to personal growth and understanding, this can be achieved through a wide variety of means. To suggest that the abyss is the only or even the best way to achieve this is both shortsighted and irresponsible.
While it is certainly a force to be reckoned with, it is not something that should be sought out or romanticized.

The abyss is a state of being that can arise at any moment, often unexpectedly and without warning. However, it seems that some individuals are determined to drive right through the abyss, as if it were no more than a minor inconvenience on their journey through life.

* Before the abyss

These individuals, whom I will refer to as "dummies," seem to operate under the assumption that they can ignore the abyss or simply power through it without any negative consequences. They act as if the abyss is a mere nuisance, something to be dismissed or shrugged off with a careless attitude. The abyss does not discriminate; it does not care about one's status, wealth, or intelligence. It will swallow anyone who is not prepared to confront it head on.

Furthermore, these dummies seem to believe that they can escape the consequences of driving through the abyss. They seem to think that they can simply carry on with their lives as if nothing happened, that no one will notice their journey through the depths of despair. However, this is simply not the case. The abyss leaves its mark on all those who encounter it, and it is impossible to completely erase this mark.

The dummies, who are often motivated by a desire for fame, fortune, or power, seem to think that they can escape the consequences of their actions by simply ignoring them or denying their existence. They drive headfirst into the abyss, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake, and yet somehow expect to emerge unscathed.

Unfortunately, this kind of behavior is all too common in today's society. From politicians and business leaders who engage in corrupt and unethical practices, to celebrities who engage in reckless and irresponsible behavior, there are too many examples of individuals who seem to think that they are above the law or immune to the effects of their actions.

This is a dangerous and shortsighted mindset that can only lead to further suffering and despair. The abyss is not something to be taken lightly or ignored. It is a force to be reckoned with and one that requires us to take responsibility for our actions and their consequences.

Î¤he overhyped nature of the abyss and the danger of romanticizing it, despite the inherent risks and lack of value associated with the abyss, it seems that many individuals are still eager to journey into its depths.

* The journey

It is a sad reality that there are those who seem to be drawn to the abyss, seemingly unaware of the perils that lurk within. They drive blindly towards it, lured by the allure of the unknown and the promise of transcendence. They seem to have no understanding of the true nature of the abyss, seeing it not as a place of despair and darkness, but as a luxurious destination that offers a chance to escape the mundane realities of everyday life.

Unfortunately, these individuals are often ill-equipped to handle the challenges that await them in the abyss. They are dummies, ill-prepared for the rigors of such a journey and lacking the necessary skills or understanding to navigate the treacherous terrain. As a result, they are often left stranded in the abyss, lost in its endless void, with no light to guide them.

It is a cautionary tale, one that serves as a reminder of the dangers of seeking out the abyss without proper understanding or preparation. It is a place that should be approached with caution and respect, not as a means of escape or a shortcut to enlightenment. Those who drive recklessly towards it do so at their own peril, and risk finding themselves lost in its depths, with no hope of return.

These dummies, as I like to call them, are like tourists who set out on a road trip without a map or a plan, carelessly driving through the abyss in their insignificant highway vans. They seem to think that the abyss is just another stop on the map, a place to be checked off their bucket list before moving on to the next adventure. But the abyss is not a place to be taken lightly or approached with such a flippant attitude.

The abyss is a place of darkness and uncertainty, a place where one's fears and doubts come to the surface. It is a place that requires a strong sense of self and a clear understanding of one's values and beliefs. Those who enter the abyss without such a foundation will find themselves lost and struggling to find their way back.

So, to all the dummies out there driving through the abyss in their insignificant highway vans, I say this: be careful. The abyss, a place to be taken seriously and approached with caution. It is a place that requires a deep understanding of oneself and a willingness to confront one's fears. If you are not prepared for this journey, turn back now before it is too late.
