#+title: Ring
* Chapter 1: The bridge crossing
The trees, those bent sinews of bark shuffled in my vision, roots scrabbling the soil, trunks lean inward as a gargoyle’s grin, their crooked boughs knuckling the earth in a mockery of salute. Up ahead, the Shire, that smug green pigbelly, gurgles with mirth I didn’t believe.

I, Frodo Baggins, the bearer of the… oh, never mind!

I lumbered through the path, into a narrow tunnel of thorns, their canes curled bristling like some ancient hedgehog’s uncombed mustache clucked it's barbed spines. Their spikes gnawed at my ankles, one splinter clutched at my coat and a button popped like a firecracker.

The mud squirms underfoot, each step birthing a new wrinkle of filth. My goat soles, once proud, now caked in mud the hue of a rancid lemon drop, dragged me down in protestations as if the very earth conspired to bill me by the step. I kick the moss sludge, and the muck now slithers and squeaks like two disgraced orators.

Dense as a wet barmaid’s apron, the fog rolls in. Not the Shire’s usual damp haze but a wet, fleshy thing that clings to my neck and it whispers in the dead tones of a drowned church organist. One tree had limped into the fog, its leaves now fluttering like a thousand fraying tongues.

A toad perched on a upturned stone birdbath, squawked with the authority of a prophet, mocking my thirst. Its throat a glistening pink balloon, voice a croak that pulsed, “Rain Rain!” I blinked. By the stars, had that bird been there two heartbeats ago? I swear not.

The path ahead splits, but both clefts lead to the same structure. Birthed from the fog, a bridge of knotted entrails, spanning a chasm where the earth yawned like a glutton’s maw. Both identical. Both snarled in rotting leaves. I chose left or right? The decision was made by my foot.

The bridge's sinewy ropes groaning as if some ancient beast had been summoned, just to die here for our benefit. Each movement squelched. The knots beneath my feet creaked, the kind of sounds echoing through motel walls at 3 AM, when the bedsprings sing their rusty hymns.

Halfway across, I stepped onto one more plank, or what passed as a plank, a single bone from an animal, which may or may not have been wise to butcher. The bone gave, it cracked and my left foot sank in up to the ankle. The abyss clutched at my calf with the enthusiasm of a grandmother who just learned her grandchild’s coming for dinner.

A moth, probably drunk on fermented nectar, collided with my forehead. I swatted it's aerial acrobatics, it's wings screaming “Ewt! Ewt!” in a voice that could only belong to a disgruntled elf.

I patted my coat. Into my pocket, fingers probing, I found a dragon’s tooth, cold, jagged, and a single button, the one that popped earlier. The tooth lodged stuck in the flap of the pocket. It had to be the one I swindled from a barkeep in Bree for a bottle of rum, no doubt.

I tried to pull it out. Stubborn thing! It resisted, caught on fabric, testing my patience. I drew it slow, slow, slow, like a sword. Finally, the tooth emerged, yellow and wicked.

The rope binding my ankle, thick as a serpent. I positioned the tooth's edge against the hemp's coarse weave, those fibers twisted together in their presumption of strength, and I sawed. Back and forth, the tooth grinding, chewing, splitting strand by strand.

At last the rope parted. The bridge sagged a bit. The abyss below stared at me with patience, knowing that gravity never forgets an appointment.

My foot yanked free, sucked from the bone gap. I stumbled forward, caught myself on the bridge's remaining ropes, those sinews still clinging to their purpose.

The rope I cut, it hung loose now, dangling like a finger wagging in disapproval.

Up ahead, the fog began to peel away in thin, shivering layers, revealing the far shore: a patch of ground flat as a sheet of parchment and ground green like a witch's sneer.

What words could better fit to a fog after all, if not for a democracy of shadows?

Behind me, the bridge snapped midair as though it had grown tired of being a bridge and, in a final act of rebellion, folded into a paper airplane and launched itself into the chasm’s gaping throat. Rocks gnashed their gums at the falling debris.

I stood on the far shore, still attached to my limbs, still fully clothed, save the missing button.

A nest of crows perched ahead, took notice of the bridge collapsing, and the whole flock erupted. Their beaks opened in unison, croaking not a death omen but an imitating, xylophonic trill of the bridge atomizing itself into a mosaic of twigs and bones.

Their wings screeched and they launched themselves into the air, hovered there a moment and dived into the yawning black trachea, which now gargled the remains with the relish of a cannibal’s stew.

The ground here, seemed to hum quiet. The fog had cleared entirely. The air was clean. The light was too bright.

* Chapter 2: Sam's house

I approached the hobbit village of Glimmerroot clung to the hillside. Houses, humps of earth they were, swollen bellies pregnant with pipe smoke, their doors circular, wood split and beetled. Windows like eyes gouged, and the spines of chimneys bent at the neck, strangled by their own smoke.

The path towards Sam's house twists in cursive, as though the ground itself is scribbling spells. Stone steps have been worn smooth by decades of hobbit feet, each a different height as if the mason had been drunk, fired, then rehired out of pity.

"Sam!" I called, my voice fracturing against the walls. No answer. His door had iron metal for a handle, rusted the color of dried blood. I gripped the handle. It burned my palm, cold as a widow's hand in a handshake of death. I pushed the door open, it shrieked its hinges.

From below, from somewhere beneath the floorboards, came a sound. “The cellar. Where the good stuff grows” I muttered to myself.

I descended the staircase, a corkscrew drilled into the earth's bowels, spiraled downward, each step narrower than the last.

Barrels lined the walls, stacked three high, their wood bloated with whatever liquids they imprisoned.

Sam was there. The floor, packed dirt, had been colonized by a colony of mushrooms, their caps fanning out in all directions, their stalks snaking across the ground, in patterns that suggested either great intelligence or great madness.

“Frodo! Frodo Baggins, you half rotted leek!” Sam’s voice boomed.

"Blimey!" he croaked, while ascending, the stairs creaking in a key that only cats could hear.

We emerged from the darkness and moved to the table, that ancient slab of wood that dominated the main room like an altar. Sam shuffled to his kitchen area, shelf upon shelf of jars, each containing liquids or solids in various stages. He selected one jar, amber liquid inside, stuff that moved when it shouldn't have moved.

“This,” Sam said, leaning forward with the intensity of a man who’d just discovered that mushrooms could be both fuel and fuel for prophecy, “is mushroom tea". His beard, bristled with sporangiophores, spitting spores like tiny parachutists into the void.

He poured. The liquid sludged from jar to cup, thick as honey, steam rose, not steam, smoke carrying with it an odor that was part earth, part death, part something else entirely, something that made my nose hairs curl in self defense.

Sam pushed the cup across the table toward me. It slid through a layer of dust, leaving a slimy trail behind it.

"It enhances lingual acuacy," I said, sipping from the cup.

"That word doesn't exist," he answered, his tea sloshing around.

“It exists, in a language I made up right now” I said, “but it may as well belong to the Thrombolic dialect, a language spoken by the fishmen of the Under Salt Sea.”


“My ring is malfunctioning lately, Sam,” I said, snatching the ring between thumb and forefinger as if it were a live coal. “For the last three days, it’s made me vanish into the wallpaper while I’m trying to eat breakfast. Think about it, toast and jam, half eaten, and poof, I’m not there. My parsnips were stranded in the air, asking questions about where their master fled.” I knocked the ring on the table. “For a year I wore the ring like a second skin. But now, it’s capricious. Yesterday, it let me be seen by a crow Sam! A bloody corvid that stole my hat!”

Sam picked up the ring, squinting at it the way a butcher examines questionable meat. Turned it over. Held it to the candlelight. The flame bent around it.

“Frodo,” he said, “this thing o’ yours, it's electronic, innit? Got circuits. Microthaumatology. Probably runs on tiny demons imprisoned in silicon. Those demons get lazy, the whole system crashes. Got wires and gizmos you don’t even know about?”

“Do I look like an engineer? What do I know about techno gobble whoop magic?” I snapped, slapping the ring onto the table. It rolled like a drunk beetle. “It’s not a toaster, Sam. It’s a doohickey from Mordor. You ever heard o’ Mordor? They make bespoke magic for folks who want to vanish.”

He leaned in, his breath sour with mushroom tea. “Mordor? As in, The Mordor? Black magic manufacturing?”

“As in the only company that sells stuff to people who won’t ask questions,” I said. The advertisement promised 'Invisibility Guaranteed'." I picked up the ring, held it to the candle light. "The salesman had excellent teeth. Very convincing teeth."

"Maybe you should phone them. Maybe that gremlin of yours is just low on firmware. Ring up the company. Tell them your ring's defective, that it's making your vanishment asymmetrical."

* Chapter 3: The mordor company

The telephone, rotary beast it was, squatted on Sam's table, a black bakelite, it's cord kinked intestinal, the receiver heavy as a club meant for skulls.

Dialed. Each number a commitment, my finger jamming the rotary holes, the mechanism churning its guts, each rotation a small eternity, clickety clickety click, a mechanical digestive process, the wheel dragging back with the resistance of a reluctant executioner.

Ring. Ring. Ring.

“Welcome to Mordor Customer Support, where your darkness is our business” a woman representative slithered from the other end. Smooth as arsenic in honey. “My name is Lurgathra, account number, please.”

I cleared my throat, spit caught there like a lodger refusing eviction. "Account seven seven three dash B dash nine. Frodo Baggins, purchaser of one invisibility ring, model Wraithmaker 3000, serial number.."

"I have your file, Mr. Baggins." Papers shuffled on her end, crisp violent sounds, like bones snapping in a efficient manner. "How may I darken your day?"

"My ring doesn't function as it should and it's gotten worse," I answered her, voice dropping to a hiss whispered. "Yesterday morning, mid-disappearance, I got stuck halfway. Top half invisible, gone, vacated the premises, bottom half plain as porridge. My legs stayed behind. They walked to the stove. They brewed tea. They were bored. My torso holidayed to the metaphysical realm, while my ankles stirred the pot!”

Silence. Then a throat clearing, professional cough.

"Mr. Baggins, let me place you on hold for one moment.."

"Wait, no.."

Music assaulted my ear canal. Not music, really. Elevator melodies composed on what sounded like a accordion made from cat intestines, violins strangled mid-note, harps weeping for mercy.

I pressed the receiver harder against my skull. Behind the music, voices. Her voice, muffled now, hand cupped over the mouthpiece some muffled voices leaked through. A chorus of Orcish wails nad her voice, distant but audible, address someone:

"Grishnákh! GRISHNÁKH! The new Orc, the one from Batch Seven, its face got stuck on the bottom of the cauldron, yes, the bottom, don't you see this one is even uglier than the rest. What do you mean 'which one?' The one that's screaming! Yes, that one. No, we can't sell it like that. I don't care if someone might want a floor faced Orc, decompose it to amino acids and start fresh. Use the big vat. The industrial vat. And for the love of the Dark Lord, stir it this time, don't just dump it in and hope." A wet, meaty splorch. "Ah yes. Young Ogg here’s having a difficulty." Metallic clattering. Another squish. "There. All better. Shhh. Good boy."

I waited. Sam watched, sipping his mushroom tea.

The music cut. Her voice returned, smooth once more.

"Thank you for holding, Mr. Baggins. I apologize for the delay. We're experiencing higher call volumes than usual, and also our manufacturing floor is experiencing what we call an 'product restructuring moment.'"

"About my ring.." I started.

"Yes. Your bisected visibility issue. I've pulled your ring's data. Model Wraithmaker 3000, purchased eighteen months ago, warranty expired.."

"Expired? I paid good coin for the extended warranty! The salesman with the excellent teeth, he promised.."

"Mr. Baggins." Her voice sharpened, knife drawn from velvet sheath. "The extended warranty covers catastrophic failure, not performance degradation. What you're experiencing is classified as 'irregular phasing,' which falls under normal wear and tear."

"Normal?" I bellowed, Sam jumping at the table's far end, his mushroom tea sloshing.

"Sir, please lower your voice. I understand your frustration. However, the execution environment logs of the ring are not available to the user. The internal workings of your ring, the diagnostic cascade, the thaumaturgic stack trace, all belong to Mordor Industries. This is a security feature to prevent reverse engineering of our proprietary invisibility algorithms."

I squeezed the receiver, knuckles whitening, imagining it was her neck, no, no, not her neck, the salesman's neck, those excellent teeth chattering as I throttled him. "Security feature? I can't even see what's wrong with my own ring?"

"Correct. The logs are encrypted seventeen times, using demonic ciphers that would liquefy your brain if you attempted to read them. This is for your protection, Mr. Baggins."

"My protection." I laughed, sound scraping up my throat like gravel through a drainpipe. "I'm half invisible on a Tuesday morning, startling the milkman into cardiac arrest, and you're protecting me?"

"Sir, I can schedule a diagnostic appointment. Our next available slot is.." papers shuffling again, that bone snap sound, "..six weeks from now, Tuesday afternoon, between the hours of two and six. Someone will arrive to examine your ring. There is a service fee of forty gold pieces, non refundable, payable in advance."

"Six weeks? Forty gold pieces?"

"Alternatively," she continued, voice smooth as a confession extracted under duress, "you could purchase our new model, the Wraithmaker 4000. It features improved phasing stability, reduced spectral bleed through, and a complimentary curse removal for the first month."

"You want me to BUY ANOTHER RING?"

"The Wraithmaker 3000 is a legacy product, Mr. Baggins. We no longer manufacture replacement parts. At a certain point, upgrading becomes more cost effective than repair."

* Chapter 4: Sauron Mordor's CEO

"Forward me," I growled into the receiver. "To your supervisor. Now. This instant."

Silence, pregnant with the weight of a thousand bureaucratic sins.

"Mr. Baggins.."

"Forward. Me."

A sigh leaked through the phone line, wind escaping a corpse's last deflation. "One moment please."

"This is Sauron. CEO, Mordor Industries."

"Sauron. The Sauron? Eye of flame, forger of.."

"Yes yes yes, all very cinematic, my branding team outdid themselves that fiscal quarter, bonuses for everyone, champagne fountains et cetera et cetera." His voice rolled like boulders down a mountain. "Now. Your ring. The Wraithmaker 3000. Serial number etched in the fires of Mount Doom, cooled in the blood of betrayed smiths. What's malfunctioning?"

"Yesterday my legs brewed tea while my torso explored the astral plane. The day before, I sneezed and my head vanished but my body stayed, walking into walls like a decapitated chicken, crashing into furniture, terrifying the neighbors." I stammered.

"Mmm." A rumble, volcanic, continental shelf deciding whether to split. "Classic firmware decay. The demons powering your ring's core processor, tiny bastards they are, have been slacking. Happens. Your case is not unique. We have clients who vanish in threes. Clients who wake up upside down, or inside out, or just flat like pancakes. Unfortunate but inevitable."

"Inevitable?" I shrieked, Sam's teacup rattling against saucer, mushrooms on the cellar floor below probably cowering. "Inevitable? I paid good gold for this ring! The salesman, those teeth of his, he promised.."

"Salesmen promise many things, Mr. Baggins." Sauron's voice oozed through the phone line, honey laced with ground glass. "They promise eternity. They promise perfection. They promise, buy once, have magic forever, which, let's be honest, in your case was probably the primary selling point, wasn't it?"

"But I'm asking: How am I supposed to fix it, if I can't see how it works, if I can't diagnose my own jewelry." I bellowed, receiver pressed so hard against my skull I'd probably have circular bruise tomorrow. "If the guts of this thing belong to Mordor industries, then who owns it? Me? Or you?"

Sauron's laugh erupted, not mirth but conquest, a sound reminding me of armies marching through burning villages, of ravens feasting on battlefield corpses, of victory flags planted in the skulls of the defeated. "Do you own it, Frodo Baggins? Or do you merely possess it?"

"That's, that's the same thing!"

"You purchased the ring, yes?" Sauron wheezed, "You misunderstand the nature of ownership in the modern age. You purchased the ring, yes? Gold exchanged hands, contract signed, perhaps in blood, perhaps in ink, the accountants don't specify. You own the physical object, the metal band warping the dimensional stability of your trousers. That's yours."

"Licensed," I repeated.

"But!" The word detonated through the phone line, shrapnel of syllables, Sam ducked like incoming artillery. "The software. The invisibility protocols. The demonic architecture that powers your vanishment—that, Mr. Baggins, you have licensed. Indefinitely, yes, for the duration of your natural life and slightly beyond, but licensed nonetheless. You own the ring. We own the magic inside it."

"And these logs, the diagnostic cascade, the thaumaturgic stack trace? You, Frodo Baggins, hobbit civilian, wants to peer into the guts of proprietary technology millennia developed? Technology that cost billions in research, in sacrifice literal, in blood spilled measured by the ocean?"

"The ring remains yours, Mr. Baggins. The invisibility, however, that we merely lend. Indefinitely, yes, perpetually even, but lend. You have a license. Irrevocable, non transferable, binding until death and then some. Should you violate the terms of service, reverse engineer the spells, share the incantations, attempt to jailbreak the curse, we reserve the right to remotely deactivate your licensed features. You'd be left with a very expensive, very useless circle of metal."

"Is that legal?"

"Perfectly legal," Sauron purred, cat satisfied after canary consumption. "Clause seventeen, subsection B, paragraph nine. 'User acknowledges that invisibility functionality constitutes licensed intellectual property and remains property sole of Mordor Industries in perpetuity plus seventy years, whichever comes last.' You signed this, Mr. Baggins. Your signature sits in our vault, preserved in amber, guarded by Balrogs."

"Should you violate the terms of service, reverse engineer the spells, share the incantations, attempt to jailbreak the curse, post the source code on public forums for other malcontents, we reserve the right, Mr. Baggins, to remotely deactivate your licensed features."

"You can turn it off?"

"With a thought. With a memo. With a checkbox on a form processed by our Legal Department, Third Floor, West Wing, Carol handles those, lovely woman, makes excellent scones for the office parties. One checkbox, Mr. Baggins, and your ring becomes jewelry. Fashionable, perhaps. Shiny, certainly. Functional?" He paused, letting the word hang like a noose. "No."

"Do we have an understanding, Mr. Baggins?"

I nodded, realized he couldn't see, croaked, "Yes."

"Wonderful. Thank you for choosing Mordor Industries, where your darkness is our business. Have a day."

Click.

The line went dead.

"Frodo," Sam said softly, "I think you need more mushroom tea."

I nodded. Words had abandoned me. Logic had fled screaming.

In a tower of black stone and spreadsheets, Sauron returned to his paperwork, another soul bound not by curses but by contracts, far more permanent, far more cruel.

The receiver sat heavy in my hand. Through the window, a crow landed, cocked its head, judging me with eyes that'd seen this conversation play out a thousand times before, in a thousand different houses, with a thousand different suckers clutching telephones and realizing too late they'd been sold snake oil by a man with beautiful teeth. So beautiful teeth!

* Chapter 5: Gandalf and the horse

The window, grimy thing it was, showed me movement, motion and the crackle of hooves on gravel announced a figure approaching.

A horse, white, one eyed, came trotting up the path like death's wedding carriage, all bone muscle coordination, it's hooves percussing against stone, clop thud clop, rhythm irregular, the beast favoring its left foreleg. One eye it had, the left socket empty, collapsed inward, a crater. The remaining eye rolled, massive as a boiled egg, surveying the world.

Gandalf sat astride it, his beard cascading, the waterfall of his hair gone feral and white as dishwater, his robes flapping.

"Sam," I hissed, "Gandalf's outside."

"Gandalf?" Sam's head whipped around, his tea sloshing. "The wizard Gandalf? Here? Now?"

We stumbled outside, the horse stopped. It breathed heavy, it's nostrils flaring, his breath steamed in the air, that shouldn't be cold but was anyway.

He dismounted, the horse snorted, that single eye rolling.

"What seems to be the problem, Frodo?" Gandalf approached.

"My ring," I started. "Bought it from Bilbo's Nephew's Shop, next to the elven hair combs section, you know the place? They sell invisibility rings, legitimate ones.."

"Legitimate," Gandalf snorted, the sound like a horse's snort, contemptuous, ancient.

"..with warning labels! Professional warning labels! 'Use this ring only if you don't respect time, space.'"

"And?" Gandalf leaned on his staff, weight shifting, waiting.

"And it's malfunctioning! Yesterday my legs walked separate from my torso. This morning? This morning, Gandalf, I blinked and my left arm vanished for six minutes. Six! Do you know how difficult it is to butter toast one armed when the missing arm is the dominant one?"

Gandalf's beard twitched, might've been smile, might've been disgust. "You phoned the manufacturer."

Not question. Statement. He knew.

"Mordor Industries. Spoke with Sauron himself. He informed me.." I spat the words, venom laced, fury soaked, "..that I own the ring but license the invisibility. That the magic inside belongs to them. Forever. Perpetually. That they can deactivate it remotely if I violate terms of service I didn't read because who reads terms of service?"

"Everyone should," Gandalf muttered, "but no one does. Tale old as time, that one."

Sam piped up, voice mouse squeaking, "He's beside himself, Gandalf. Proper unraveled. Been drinking my mushroom tea and spiraling about ownership versus possession and.."

"How about you Gandalf?" I asked, "Why ride this cyclopean abomination instead of driving something sensible?"

The horse snorted again, offended possibly, that single eye narrowing.

"Update," Gandalf growled, word bitten off sharp. "Software update. Automatic software update installed itself during the night while my vehicle sat charging. Midnight. No warning. No consent. Just ping, 'Update available, installing now, do not disconnect power, this will take fifteen minutes.'"

"Fifteen minutes?" Sam asked.

"Seventeen hours," Gandalf roared, staff striking ground, sparks flying, actual sparks, little fires dying quick. "Seventeen hours of 'Optimizing system performance, please wait.' Morning came. Sun rose, birds sang their stupid songs. Car still optimizing. Still waiting. Checked the forums.."

"Forums?" I blinked.

"Wizard forums. Tech support for the magically inclined. Apparently this update, version 7.4.2, bricks vehicles manufactured before the Year of the Twisted Moon. Bricks them. Immobilizes them completely. Won't start. Won't charge. Just sits there, driveway decoration'."

"So you're riding.." I gestured toward the horse.

"Magnus," Gandalf said. "His name is Magnus. One eyed white stallion. I needed transportation, he needed purpose."

Magnus stamped hoof, singular eye fixing on me, it's pupil dilating, contracting, unsettling in hypnotic rhythm.

"How long until your car's fixed?" Sam ventured.

"Tech support says patch coming next week. Maybe. Possibly. 'Soon.' You know how these things go. Meanwhile, I ride Magnus. We bond. He tolerates me. Now. About your ring. Let me see it."

I pulled the ring from pocket, held it out, metal catching light wrong, bending it, distorting it, reality rippling around the circumference.

Gandalf took it, held it close, eye squinting, other eye squinting differently, examining, probing, muttering words I didn't recognize, probably shouldn't recognize.

"Mmm," he finally said. "Yes. Definitely cheap. Definitely cursed. Definitely violating approximately seven hundred regulations regarding dimensional manipulation. You're lucky you haven't phased through the planet core yet."

"Can you fix it?"

He tossed the ring back. I caught it, fumbled, nearly dropped it.

"No, Frodo. I cannot fix it. No one can fix it without the execution trace, because fixing costs only the replacement parts and selling you new model makes more money. Simple economics. Old as dragons hoarding gold. Older."

Magnus whinnied, agreement possibly, or hunger. Hard to tell with one eyed horses.

Sam muttered something about “not this again” and retreated into the cellar.

* Chapter 6: Riding to Mordor

“Mordor,” Gandalf announced, his staff planted vertical like a flag claimed in conquered soil. The word hung there, fat and final. “We go to their headquarters. The glass tower, downtown district, thirty seventh floor.”

“You’re joking,” I said, but his beard had gone rigid, its bristles electric with purpose. Gandalf never jokes, not about corporations, not about towers that scrape the clouds and house departments named “Customer Service.”

“Confronting them face to face,” he growled, his staff planted, each syllable a stone dropped in still water. “Eyeball to eyeball. You want diagnostic data? You want execution traces? You want them to open their proprietary vault and spill secrets? Phone calls get you nowhere. Emails vanish into spam folders guarded by Nazguls. But presence, breathing their recycled air, standing in their lobby with its potted ferns dying slow deaths under fluorescent lights, that makes them uncomfortable.”

Magnus stamped, his hoof striking the earth his single eye, massive as a hard boiled egg left too long in brine, swiveled and fixed on me. The assessment was brutal. The calculation was merciless.

“Both of us?” I asked. My voice climbed octaves, became a mouse squeak, became a plea. “On... that?”

“Magnus carries two,” Gandalf said, his voice flat as hammered iron. “He did it during the War of the Shattered Circle beneath a sky of falling ashes. He carried me and Saruman seventeen leagues while we dodged demons. He’ll manage one wizard, one half panicked hobbit. Get on.”

I approached. Magnus was a mountain, a cliff face white and vertical. Gandalf mounted first, his movement fluid like oil poured, like mercury sliding, practice having made it theater. He settled forward, his spine straight as accusation, and he offered his hand down to me. His arm extended, his sleeve flapping, the fabric a great, useless wing.

I grabbed and settled behind Gandalf, gripping his robes.

“Don’t fall off,” Gandalf advised, his tone conversational, as if he were discussing mild weather. “Magnus dislikes stopping.”

Magnus’s hooves moved. Clop thud clop. The rhythm established itself, a metronome cruel and steady. The path unfolded beneath us, the dirt becoming gravel, stones crunching like bones under the wheels of carts that had carried plague victims centuries ago.

The trees passed by, becoming blurs of green and brown, their branches clawing at the air we’d already vacated.

“Take the highway,” I shouted, my voice shredded by wind, by Magnus’s furnace hot breathing.

Gandalf turned his head partially; his beard whipped like flags in a storm. “Highway?”

“Yes. Highway. The asphalt ribbon, black and smooth, where modern vehicles conduct their petroleum powered pilgrimages. We’ll get there quicker. Faster. In six hours instead of twelve.”

He considered it, his hand rising to stroke his beard as the wind tangled it worse, creating knots that would require industrial solvents to unpick. “Magnus,” he addressed the horse, “can handle the highway traffic. Can’t you, Magnus?”

Magnus snorted, agreement perhaps, perhaps just clearing his nostrils of flies that had been investigating.

We turned. The path shifted beneath us, gravel transitioning to asphalt, the surface smooth, too smooth, an unnatural smoothness achieved through machines that heated the earth’s bones and spread them flat.

The on ramp rose before us, a concrete curve spiraling upward like a twisted DNA strand, ascending into the metal river that flowed fast and deadly. The traffic streamed, vehicles hurtling, metal comets with humans trapped inside their velocity.

Magnus hit the highway. His hooves struck the asphalt, the sound echoing clop clop clop amplified by a surface not meant for hooves but for vulcanized rubber.

Cars streamed past. A Ford to the left, a blue blur, whoooosh, its sound compressed and stretched. A horn blared, the sustained note of fury; the driver’s face was visible one instant, mouth wide, screaming, eyes bulging like fish dragged onto decks, then gone, swallowed by the distance.

An SUV to the right, a silver beast with a chrome grille grinning shark like, whoooosh. The driver gestured, raising a single finger, accusatory and anatomically improbable in its suggested trajectory.

A truck roared past, eighteen wheels of mechanical thunder. The gust slammed us sideways, a contained hurricane; Magnus compensated, his muscles flexing and adjusting, his hooves finding purchase on the treacherous asphalt. We survived. Barely. The truck’s horn, deep, basso profundo, the voice of an angry diesel god, blasted an obscene farewell.

Ahead, a structure emerged from heat shimmer and distance: a toll plaza. It's booths squatted across lanes like concrete toads, barriers mechanical with arms rising and falling, rising again in a hypnotic rhythm.

We approached it. Magnus slowed, his hooves gentler now, clop clop clop, almost polite, almost apologetic for existing in a space not designed for his kind.

A booth door opened. A woman emerged, her uniform crisp despite the heat, despite the improbability. Her face was confusion incarnate, disbelief given flesh, and a nametag that read 'Debra' was pinned to her chest. Her eyebrows rose toward her hairline; her mouth opened, closed, opened again like a fish gasping on dock boards.

“You cannot drive this animal on the highway!”

Gandalf straightened.

“Drive?” His voice dropped, plummeted, an octave falling into the basement where light goes to die. He held the word, examined it, found it wanting, dripping with disdain, soaked in contempt, oceanic in scale.

He paused.

“Ride. We ride the horse.”

The grammar lesson was delivered. His tone was professorial, condescending; the verb was corrected; the action clarified; the linguistic crime was punished immediately.

Debra blinked, processing as if a syntax error were visible, her hands flailed now, gestures desperate, a drowning woman clutching at the absence of air.

“Horses aren’t allowed! No animals! No livestock!”

“We'll take the next exit and go through the forest,” Gandalf announced.

Magnus hooves resumed, clop clop clop, with Debra shouting behind us, her words dissolving into wind.

* Chapter 7: The recharging station

The off-ramp curved, spiraled downwards, Magnus descended carefully, his hooves picking a path through cracks where ambitious weeds pushed through, reclaiming territory one root at a time. We reached to the bottom, we reached street level, we reached a situation that was bizarre.

Cars were everywhere, dozens, scores, maybe hundreds obscured in the distance. Dead they sat, automotive corpses, their doors hung open like fish mouths gasping final breaths, their hoods exposed their failing metal hearts. Drivers stood, congregating; a cluster of confusion with panic percolating through.

We slowed to a walk, Magnus's hooves, clip, clop, clip, polite percussion, respectful of the dead machinery surrounding. The beast knew death when he smelled it, even death silicon based, battery powered.

A recharging station loomed center stage with a skeletal metal frame, solar panels spread overhead wing like, useless now as tits on a bull. Beneath it, charging stalls stood empty, cables dangling limp as dead snakes, their connectors mouths open, hungry, unpowered.

A man in glasses, wire rimmed, pristine, stood near the entrance kiosk, hands gesturing sharp at the gathering crowd. His polo shirt bore an embroidered logo: "GreenCharge Station."

"Look, I don't know what happened! The system just, it went dark. All of it. The Powerwalls, the solar feed, the backup grid connection, everything. I've got corporate on hold for forty minutes and they keep playing that goddamn smooth jazz. Just click. Gone. My whole Powerwall garage system, dead. Seventy three percent charge I had. Had. Dashboard lit up, 'Power System Failure', then nothing. Dead. Deader than my marriage, deader than my hope of retiring before seventy."

A woman beside him, wearing yoga pants, sunglasses expensive perched atop her head, "I am.." she gestured violent, hands chopping air, "..two miles from home. Two miles. Now I'm here, stranded at this godforsaken charging station that won't charge, watching my groceries spoil in the trunk. Ice cream's melted. Chicken's warming. I've got a Zoom call in forty minutes and my laptop's in the car and the car won't.."

Voice cut off. Hands covered her face.

"Should've read the terms," another voice said. A younger man, tablet tucked under his arm, stepped forward. "Section seven, subsection D, paragraph twelve. 'Company reserves right to disable, modify, or terminate functionality of any connected device, at any time, for any reason company deems necessary, including but not limited to safety concerns, regulatory compliance, or strategic business decisions. User agrees to waive all claims.' You all clicked 'I Agree.' You agreed."

"Oh, shut up, nobody reads those," the yoga pants woman said. Simple. Final.

An older man leaned against a truck bed, coveralls wearing grease ancient, hands tattooed permanent with motor oil. His face leather worn, sun beaten, eyes squinted to slits calculating. "Powerwalls," he said, voice gravel rough, each word a stone dropped. "The solar recharging stations, all of them, run on Powerwall batteries, model HX Nine. The company that made them, installed them, and promised 'revolutionize energy independence' and 'power freedom.' Freedom." He spat. The brown glob hit the asphalt, it sizzled quiet. "This morning, zero dark thirty, company flipped the switch. Kill switch. The batteries had faulty chemistry, their lithium cells degrading faster than projected, their thermal runaway imminent. Remotely deactivated every single Powerwall unit, simultaneously."

One man kicked his car's tire. Hard. His foot rebounded, pain obvious from the way he hopped, cursing string of pearls style, each word a gem polished by fury.

A man slumped against a car, phone dangling from his hand, voice robot recorded emanating: "Your estimated wait time is, thirty seven minutes. Please continue holding. Your call is important.."

"Important?" he screamed at the phone. "Then answer, you algorithmic bastards."

We rode past. Magnus's hooves found rhythm again. Clop thud clop. Steady. Certain. Carrying us forward away.

Behind us, more voices rose, layered cacophony style: complaints, threats, prayers maybe. Someone sobbed. Someone else laughed, a child asked, "Daddy, when are we going home?" and received no answer.

* Chapter 8: The toroidal Spider

The forest swallowed us whole; the trees stood trunk to trunk like conspirators. Light, what little remained of it, dripped through gaps in the canopy in stripes, illuminating patches of dirt and root and the occasional moss bearded stone.

Magnus’s hooves found soft purchase on centuries’ worth of pine needles, muffling our approach into near silence, save for the beast’s breathing, that bellows rhythm in and out.

Then, a sign.

A wooden thing, planted crooked in the earth, letters carved deep and paint peeling in strips like sunburned skin. The words proclaimed, with dubious authority: “THE PATH OF TOROIDAL SPIDER, PROCEED WITH CAUTION OR DON’T PROCEED AT ALL. WE’RE NOT YOUR MOTHER.”

Below that, in smaller script, barely legible: "Seriously. She'll eat you. We've lost six couriers this month."

And there she was. The spider.

She was giant, her body as bulbous as a prize winning pumpkin, her eight legs articulated as tradition demanded, each joint clicking audible even from a distance. Perched in the toroid’s center, legs spread radial and engaged in purposeful activity. Thin as human hair but gleaming metallic, a copper wire gleamed in her mandibles as she wrapped it around the toroid’s circumference, each rotation precise.

“Seven,” she counted, her voice clicking, consonants sharp as scissors. Her legs moved, synchronized, balletic as she wrapped. “Eight.” Another rotation, the wire catching the light and forming a helical pattern.

“Nine.” She paused, one leg raised.

Then, motion. She uncoiled, released the wire, and descended from the toroid.

Magnus backed up; his hooves shuffled, his solitary eye rolling panic adjacent. Gandalf’s hand tightened on his staff.

The spider touched ground, legs splaying wide, body lowered predatory. She approached with deliberate, precise steps, mechanical in execution but graceful underneath.

“Why,” I croaked, my throat dry as ancient parchment, “aren’t you knitting a web anymore?”

She tilted her body, an almost quizzical gesture. “Knitting?” Her voice clicked, percussive. “Knitting is obsolete. Webs are primitive. Sticky and inefficient. I construct electronics now. Transformers. Inductors. Resonant circuits. The future is electromagnetic.”

A sudden light cut from the canopy, a thin red laser, and zap: a mosquito exploded, a tiny detonation, wings scattered.

The spider moved impossibly fast. One leg extended, caught the mosquito remains midair, and brought them to her mandibles. She chewed, thoughtful.

“Hmm,” she said, appreciative, “buttery.”

She swallowed and turned her attention back to us.

“That laser,” I said, pointing vaguely in its direction, “you built that?”

“Obviously,” she said. Her eight legs shifted, impatient. “Solid state diode laser. Custom optics. Motion tracking algorithm. Autonomous targeting system. Mosquitos make excellent beta testers, high contrast against the sky, flight patterns erratic enough to challenge calibration. Plus,” she clicked her mandibles together with satisfaction, “delicious. The laser caramelizes them slightly. Adds flavor complexity.”

Gandalf leaned forward in his saddle. “You abandoned web spinning,” he rumbled, “for circuit construction?”

She gestured with a leg toward the toroid still suspended and rotating slowly in the background. “Webs are single purpose: catch food. Boring. Predictable. But electronics, have endless applications. Signal processing. Power conversion. Wireless charging. I’m developing an inductive coupling system for moth to moth communication. Revolutionary.”

From the canopy another mosquito descended, its path suicidal. Zap. The laser found it instantly. The corpse drifted down; the spider caught and consumed it.

“Mmm,” she said. “That one had notes of swamp water and O negative blood.”

Magnus pawed at the ground, his hoof scraping stone. I didn’t blame him.

* Chapter 9: The spider's advice

The spider pivoted and scuttled toward a contraption, wedged between two trees. A laptop, some silicon brained abomination, sat perched on a platform of woven optical fiber, its screen glowing cancer blue in the forest's murk.

She approached it, her foremost legs extending, touching the keyboard with a delicacy that seemed obscene given her bulk. The keys clicked, tap tap tap tap, her legs moving with typing pool precision, each stroke deliberate.

"Inductance," she announced, voice cutting through the air like scissors through wet newspaper. "The toroid's inductance must be calculated. Precision is paramount. Guesswork is for mammals."

On screen, windows bloomed, code cascading, algorithms unfurling like intestines from a gutted fish. Computer code, the syntax foreign as Elvish grocery lists. Numbers appeared, scrolled, vanished, reappeared elsewhere.

"I've implemented," she said, one leg gesturing at the screen while six others continued typing and one scratched at her abdomen, "an AI algorithm. Machine learning. Neural networks trained on electromagnetic theory. It calculates inductance using the formula.."

She paused, the screen flashed, displayed an equation:

[
\boxed{,L ;=; \frac{\mu,N^{2},h}{2\pi},\ln!\left(\frac{r_{\text{r_spider_last_knuckle}}}{r_{\text{r_spider_body}}}\right),}
]

"There," she said, voice proud as a mother showing off her firstborn's finger paintings. "The inductance formula. Modified. See those variables? I take measurements from my own anatomy. The radius from my body's center to my last knuckle joint. I am the reference standard. The toroid's geometry mirrors my own proportions. Elegant, no?"

Another leg tapped the screen, indicating the variables. "My body radius: four point seven meters. Last knuckle radius: half a meter. The natural logarithm of their ratio, multiplied by the appropriate constants, yields inductance. The AI processes this, accounts for wire gauge, turn density, core permeability. It's beautiful. Mathematics made flesh. Or.." she clicked thoughtfully, "..flesh made mathematics."

The algorithm churned, the screen flickering with progress bars and rotating calculation wheels, that universal symbol of machines thinking, or whatever silicon does when it's pretending to be conscious.

"AI," she continued, turning slightly toward us, her multiple eyes catching the laptop's glow and reflecting it back in miniature galaxies, "is a tool. Data analysis. Data mining. I feed it entropy, chunks of information, compressed or chaotic, depending on what's required. Long chunks of low entropy data: structured databases, electromagnetic field measurements, wire resistance tables. Small chunks of high entropy data: randomized test inputs, chaotic signal noise, mosquito flight patterns. The algorithm learns."

She gestured with one leg toward the forest around us. "Out here, everything generates data. Temperature fluctuations. Wind velocity. Electromagnetic interference from nearby power lines, yes even here, civilization's tendrils reach, invisible but measurable. I mine it. Extract patterns.

Bing.

The laptop emitted a cheerful notification sound.

"Calculation complete," the spider announced. "Inductance: thirty seven point four millihenries. Acceptable for my purposes. The toroid will function as designed."

Magnus shifted beneath us, his hooves restless, that single eye rolling in its socket like a marble in a tilted jar. The beast knew something. Animals always know before hobbits catch up, their instincts faster than our plodding reason.

The spider turned fully toward us now, all eight legs planted, body lowered slightly, a stance I recognized from nature documentaries, the moment before the pounce, before teeth or mandibles or whatever weaponry evolution had gifted closed around prey.

"Now," she said, voice shifting, honeyed almost, the tone salesmen use when they're about to shaft you, "about payment. For the calculation demonstration."

From above, from the canopy where shadows grew thick and light refused to penetrate, came a sound. A mechanical whirr. A focusing lens adjusting.

The laser.

Red light materialized, a beam thin as thread but bright as a dying star, and it cut.

Not us.

Magnus.

The horse didn't scream, couldn't scream, because the laser moved too fast. It sliced vertical, surgical, precise, from skull to tail in one continuous motion.

The horse separated.

Two halves.

Left and right.

They stood for a moment, both halves upright. The left half had the eye, that massive, pupil dilated wide in what might have been horror or surprise or simply the body's last confusion. The right half had the empty socket, the crater where an eye should have been, dark and vacant.

Then gravity remembered its job.

Both halves collapsed, fell away from each other, hit the ground with thuds that were too soft, too final. Gandalf and I tumbled, dismounting involuntarily, hitting the pine needles and rolling away from the bisected corpse.

The spider approached. Her legs moved delicate now, respectful almost, as she examined the two halves of Magnus. She touched the one with the eye, the left side, with one leg, gentle.

"I will keep the horse," she announced, her voice flat, matter of fact. "For the advice."
*  Κεφάλαιον Α': Ἡ Διάβασις τῆς Γεφύρας

Τὰ δένδρα, ἐκεῖνα τὰ κεκαμμένα νεῦρα φλοιοῦ, ἐσαλεύοντο ἐν τῇ ὄψει μου, αἱ ῥίζαι τὴν γῆν ἐξύοντο, οἱ κορμοὶ ἔκλινον εἴσω ὡς γοργόνος μειδίαμα, οἱ σκολιοὶ κλάδοι τὴν γῆν ἐκονδυλίζοντο ἐν μιμήσει ἀσπασμοῦ. Πρόσθεν, ἡ Σχοῖνος, ἐκείνη ἡ αὐθάδης χλωρὰ γαστὴρ χοίρου, γελᾷ γέλωτα ᾧ οὐκ ἐπίστευον.

Ἐγώ, Φροδίων ὁ Βαγγῖνος, ὁ φέρων τὸ... ὦ, μηδὲν μέλοι!

Ἐβάδιζον βαρέως διὰ τῆς ὁδοῦ, εἰς στενὸν ὄρυγμα ἀκανθῶν, ὧν αἱ κάλαμοι ἐστρέφοντο χαῖται ὡς ἀρχαίου ἐχίνου ἀχτένιστος μύσταξ τοὺς ἀγκιστροειδεῖς ἄκανθας ἐκακκάβιζεν. Αἱ αἰχμαὶ τοὺς ἀστραγάλους μου ἐδάκνον, μία σχίδαξ τὸν χιτῶνά μου ἐλάβετο καὶ κόμβος ἀνέπηδε ὡς πυρσός.

Ὁ πηλὸς ὑπὸ ποδῶν στρέφεται, ἕκαστον βῆμα νέαν ῥυτίδα ῥύπου γεννᾷ. Αἱ αἰγείοι πέδιλαί μου, πρὶν μὲν ὑπερήφανοι, νῦν δὲ πηλῷ κεχρισμέναι τῷ χρώματι σηπεδόνος λιμνησίου ποώδους, κατέσπων με ἐν διαμαρτυρίαις ὡς ἡ γῆ αὐτὴ συνεμάχετο τιμὴν πράττεσθαι κατὰ βῆμα. Λακτίζω τὸν βρύον ἰλύν, καὶ ὁ βόρβορος νῦν ὀλισθαίνει καὶ τρίζει ὡς δύο ἠτιμασμένοι ῥήτορες.

Παχεῖα ὡς ὑγρὸν σιμβλίον καπήλισσης, ἡ ὁμίχλη προσκυλίεται. Οὐχ ἡ συνήθης ὑγρὰ ἀχλὺς τῆς Σχοίνου ἀλλ' ὑγρόν, σαρκῶδες πρᾶγμα ὃ τῷ τραχήλῳ μου προσκολλᾶται καὶ ψιθυρίζει τοῖς νεκροῖς τόνοις πνιγέντος ὀργάνου ναοῦ. Ἓν δένδρον εἰς τὸ νέφος ἐχώλαινε, τὰ φύλλα νῦν πτερυγίζοντα ὡς χίλιαι λωβώμεναι γλῶσσαι.

Βάτραχος ἐφ᾽ ὑπτίου λίθου λουτρῶνος ἐκάθητο, ἐκοάξε μετὰ τῆς ἐξουσίας προφήτου, τὴν δίψαν μου χλευάζων. Ὁ λαιμὸς αὐτοῦ στίλβων ῥοδόχρους φυσαλλίς, ἡ φωνὴ κρωγμὸς ὃς ἐπάλλετο, "Ὄμβρος! Ὄμβρος!" Ἔβλεψα. Πρὸς τῶν ἄστρων, ἆρ᾽ ἐκεῖνος ὁ ὄρνις ἐκεῖ ἦν δύο σφυγμοὺς πρότερον; Ὀμνύω οὔ.

Ἡ ὁδὸς πρόσθεν σχίζεται, ἀλλ' ἀμφότεραι σχίσεις πρὸς τὴν αὐτὴν κατασκευὴν ἄγουσιν. Ἐκ τῆς ὁμίχλης γεγεννημένη, γέφυρα συμπεπλεγμένων ἐντέρων, ὑπερτείνουσα χάσματος οὗ ἡ γῆ ἐχῄνωσεν ὥσπερ γαστριμάργου στόμα. Ἀμφότεραι ὅμοιαι. Ἀμφότεραι ἐμπεπλεγμέναι σηπομένοις φύλλοις. Ἀριστερὰν ἢ δεξιὰν εἱλόμην; Ὁ πούς μου τὴν κρίσιν ἐποίησεν.

Τὰ νευρώδη σχοινία τῆς γεφύρας στενάζοντα ὡς εἴ τι ἀρχαῖον θηρίον κέκληται, ἵνα αὐτόθι ἀποθάνῃ πρὸς τὴν ἡμετέραν ὠφέλειαν. Ἑκάστη κίνησις ἐχλίαινεν. Οἱ δεσμοὶ ὑπὸ τοὺς πόδας μου ἔτριζον, τὰ εἴδη τῶν ψόφων διὰ τειχῶν πανδοκείου περὶ τὴν τρίτην ὥραν νυκτὸς ἠχοῦντα, ὅτε αἱ κλίναι τοὺς κατιωμένους ὕμνους ᾄδουσιν.

Μέσῃ τῇ διαβάσει, ἐπέβην ἐπὶ μίαν σανίδα ἔτι, ἢ ὅ τι σανίδα ἐνομίζετο, μόνον ὀστοῦν ἀπὸ ζῴου, ὃ σφαγῆναι ἴσως σοφὸν οὐκ ἦν. Τὸ ὀστοῦν ἐνέδωκεν, ἔρρηξε καὶ ὁ ἀριστερὸς πούς μου κατέδυ μέχρι τοῦ ἀστραγάλου. Ἡ ἄβυσσος τὴν κνήμην μου συνέλαβε τῇ προθυμίᾳ μάμμης ἥτις ἄρτι ἔμαθε τὸν ἔκγονον πρὸς δεῖπνον ἐρχόμενον.

Σὴς τις, ἴσως μεθύων ἐκ ζυμωθέντος νέκταρος, τῷ μετώπῳ μου προσέκρουσε. Τὰς ἀεροβατικὰς ἀτάξεις ἐρράπισα, αἱ πτέρυγες αὐτοῦ ἐβόων "Εὐτ! Εὐτ!" φωνῇ ἥτις μόνον δυσθυμοῦντι ἔλφῳ ἀνήκειν ἐδύνατο.

Τὸν χιτῶνά μου ἐψηλάφησα. Εἰς τὸν κόλπον μου, δάκτυλοι ἐρευνῶντες, δράκοντος ὀδόντα εὗρον, ψυχρόν, τραχύν, καὶ κόμβον ἕνα, τὸν προπηδήσαντα πρότερον. Ὁ ὀδοὺς ἐνείλητο ἐν τῇ πτυχῇ τοῦ κόλπου. Ἔδει εἶναι τὸν ὃν ἀπὸ καπήλου ἐν Βρήᾳ ἀντὶ φιάλης οἴνου ἔλαβον, ἀναμφιβόλως.

Ἐπειράθην ἐξελκύσαι αὐτόν. Αὐθάδες πρᾶγμα! Ἀντέστη, ὑφάσματι ληφθείς, τὴν ὑπομονήν μου δοκιμάζων. Εἷλκον αὐτὸν βραδέως, βραδέως, βραδέως, ὡς ξίφος. Τέλος, ὁ ὀδοὺς ἐξῆλθε, ξανθὸς καὶ κακοῦργος.

Ἡ σχοῖνος δεσμοῦσα τὸν ἀστράγαλόν μου, παχεῖα ὡς ὄφις. Τὴν ἀκμὴν τοῦ ὀδόντος κατὰ τῆς κανναβίνου τραχείας πλοκῆς ἔθηκα, ἐκείνων τῶν ἰνῶν συμπεπλεγμένων ἐν τῷ οἰήματι ἰσχύος, καὶ ἔπριον. Πρόσω καὶ ὀπίσω, ὁ ὀδοὺς τρίβων, τρώγων, σχίζων ἶνα κατὰ ἶναν.

Τέλος ἡ σχοῖνος διέστη. Ἡ γέφυρα μικρόν τι ἔκαμψεν. Ἡ ἄβυσσος κάτω με ἐθεώρει μετ᾽ ὑπομονῆς, εἰδυῖα ὅτι ἡ βαρύτης οὐδέποτε λήθεται συναντήσεως.

Ὁ πούς μου ἐξεσπάσθη ἐλεύθερος, ἐκ τοῦ ὀστεΐνου χάσματος ἐξεμύχθη. Ἐσφάλην πρόσω, ἐμαυτὸν ἐπὶ τῶν λοιπῶν σχοίνων τῆς γεφύρας ἔλαβον, ἐκείνων τῶν νεύρων ἔτι τῷ σκοπῷ προσεχομένων.

Τὸ σχοινίον ὃ ἔτεμον, χαλαρὸν νῦν ἐκρέματο, αἰωρούμενον ὡς δάκτυλος ἐν ἀποδοκιμασίᾳ σειόμενος.

Πρόσω, τὸ νέφος λεπίζεσθαι ἤρξατο λεπτοῖς τρέμουσι στρώμασιν, ἀποκαλύπτον τὴν πέραν ὄχθην: τμῆμα γῆς ἐπίπεδον ὡς δέλτος βύβλου καὶ χλωρὸν ὡς φαρμακίδος χλεύασμα.

Τίνες λόγοι ἄμεινον ἁρμόσειαν νέφει τελικῶς, εἰ μὴ δημοκρατία σκιῶν;

Ὄπισθέν μου, ἡ γέφυρα μετέωρος ἔρρηξεν ὡς ἂν ἀπειρήκει γέφυρα εἶναι καί, ἐν τελευταίᾳ πράξει ἀποστασίας, εἰς χάρτινον ἀεροπλάνον συνεπτύχθη καὶ ἑαυτὴν εἰς τὸν χάσκοντα λαιμὸν τοῦ χάσματος ἔρριψεν. Πέτραι τὰς οὔλας ἔτριζον ἐπὶ τοῖς πίπτουσι συντριμμάτοις.

Ἐπὶ τῆς πέραν ὄχθης ἵσταμαι, ἔτι τοῖς μέλεσι προσηρτημένος, ἔτι πλήρως ἠμφιεσμένος, πλὴν τοῦ ἀπολομένου κόμβου.

Νεοττιὰ κοράκων πρόσθεν καθημένων, τῆς καταπιπτούσης γεφύρας προσέσχον, καὶ πᾶν τὸ σμῆνος ἐξέβρασεν. Τὰ ῥάμφη ὁμοῦ ἠνοίχθη, κρώζοντα οὐ θανάτου οἰωνόν, ἀλλὰ μιμουμένην, ξυλοφωνικὴν τρυλλίδα τῆς γεφύρας ἑαυτὴν ἀτομιζούσης εἰς μωσαϊκὸν κλάδων καὶ ὀστέων.

Αἱ πτέρυγες ἔκραξαν καὶ ἑαυτὰς εἰς τὸν ἀέρα ἔρριψαν, ἐκεῖ στιγμὴν ἐμέτωροι ἔμειναν καὶ εἰς τὴν χάσκουσαν μέλαιναν τραχεῖαν ἐβύθισαν, ἥτις νῦν τὰ λείψανα ἐγαργάριζε μετὰ τῆς ἡδονῆς ἀνθρωποφάγου ζωμοῦ.

Ἡ γῆ ὧδε, βομβεῖν ἐδόκει σιγῇ. Τὸ νέφος ἐντελῶς διελέλυτο. Ὁ ἀὴρ καθαρὸς ἦν. Τὸ φῶς λίαν λαμπρὸν ἦν.

* 1 Κεφάλαιον Β΄: Ἡ Οἰκία τοῦ Σαμυίου

Προσῆλθον τῇ τῶν χομπίτων κώμῃ Λαμπρορρίζῳ τῇ προσκειμένῃ τῷ λόφῳ. Οἰκίαι, γῆς ὄγκοι ἦσαν, γαστέρες πεφυσημέναι κύουσαι καπνὸν καλαμίνης, αἱ θύραι κυκλοειδεῖς, ξύλον διερρηγμένον καὶ κανθαρόφρυκτον. Θυρίδες ὡς ὀφθαλμοὶ ἐξορυχθέντες, αἱ δὲ ῥάχεις τῶν καπνοδόχων ἐκάμφθησαν κατὰ τὸν αὐχένα, πνιγόμεναι ὑπὸ τοῦ ἰδίου καπνοῦ.

Ἡ ὁδὸς πρὸς τὴν οἰκίαν τοῦ Σαμυίου ἑλίσσεται γραμματοειδῶς, ὡς ἂν εἰ ἡ γῆ αὐτὴ γοητείας ἔγραφεν. Βάθρα λίθινα ἐτετρίφατο λεῖα ὑπὸ δεκαετιῶν ποδῶν χομπιτικῶν, ἕκαστον ἄλλου ὕψους ὡς ἂν εἰ ὁ λιθουργὸς μεθύων ἐτετύχει, ἀπολυθείς, εἶτα πάλιν μισθωθεὶς ἐξ οἴκτου.

"Ὦ Σαμύιε!" ἐκάλεσα, ἡ φωνή μου θραυομένη πρὸς τοῖς τοίχοις. Οὐδεμία ἀπόκρισις. Ἡ θύρα αὐτοῦ σίδηρον εἶχε λαβήν, κατιωμένην τὴν χροιὰν αἵματος ξηροῦ. Ἐκράτησα τὴν λαβήν. Ἔκαυσέ μου τὴν χεῖρα, ψυχρὰ ὡς χεὶρ χήρας ἐν ἀσπασμῷ θανάτου. Ὤθησα τὴν θύραν, ἐκέκραγεν τοὺς στρόφιγγας.

Κάτωθεν, ἐκ τινος ὑπὸ τοὺς σανίδας, ἦλθε ψόφος. "Ὁ ὑπόγειος. Ὅπου τὰ ἀγαθὰ φύεται" ἐφθεγξάμην ἐμαυτῷ.

Κατέβην τὴν κλίμακα, τρύπανον ἑλικοειδὲς εἰς τὰ ἔντερα τῆς γῆς διατορηθέν, ἑλισσόμενον κάτω, ἕκαστον βαθμίδιον στενότερον τοῦ προτέρου.

Πίθοι παρὰ τοῖς τοίχοις ἐστοιχίζοντο, τρεῖς τὸ ὕψος, τὸ ξύλον αὐτῶν ἐξογκωμένον ὑπὸ τῶν ὑγρῶν ὧν ἐδεσμεύοντο.

Ὁ Σαμύιος ἦν ἐκεῖ. Τὸ ἔδαφος, γῆ πεπατημένη, ᾠκίσθη ὑπὸ ἀποικίας μυκήτων, τὰ πίλια αὐτῶν ἀναπεπταμένα πρὸς πάσας τὰς ὁδούς, οἱ καυλοὶ ὀφεοειδῶς διὰ τῆς γῆς ἕρποντες, ἐν σχήμασιν ὑποδεικνύουσιν ἢ μεγάλην σύνεσιν ἢ μεγάλην μανίαν.

"Φροδίων! Φροδίων Βαγγίνε, σὺ ἡμίσεπτον πράσον!" ἡ φωνὴ τοῦ Σαμυίου ἐβρόντησεν.

"Ἰὼ Ζεῦ!" ἔκραξεν, ἀναβαίνων, ἡ κλῖμαξ τρίζουσα ἐν κλειδὶ ἣν μόνον αἱ αἴλουροι ἤκουον.

Ἀνήλθομεν ἐκ τοῦ σκότους καὶ προσήλθομεν τῇ τραπέζῃ, τῇ ἀρχαίᾳ πλακὶ ξυλίνῃ ἥτις ἐκυρίευεν τοῦ μεγάρου ὡς βωμός. Ὁ Σαμύιος ἐπορεύθη σύρων πρὸς τὸ μαγειρικὸν χωρίον, θύλακος ἐπὶ θύλακον ἀγγείων, ἕκαστον περιέχον ὑγρὰ ἢ στερεὰ ἐν διαφόροις βαθμίσι. Ἐξελέξατο ἓν ἀγγεῖον, ὑγρὸν ἠλέκτρινον ἔνδον, τοῦτο ὃ ἐκινεῖτο ὅτε οὐκ ἔδει κινεῖσθαι.

"Τοῦτο," ὁ Σαμύιος εἶπε, προκύπτων μετὰ τῆς σπουδῆς ἀνδρὸς ὃς ἄρτι ἀνεῦρε μύκητας καὶ καύσιμον καὶ πρὸς μαντείαν καύσιμον γενέσθαι δυνάμενον, "ἐστὶ μυκητικὸν δεῖπνον." Ὁ πώγων αὐτοῦ, φρίσσων σποραγγιοφόροις, πτύων σπόρους ὡς μικροὺς παραπηδιστὰς εἰς τὸ κενόν.

Ἔχεεν. Τὸ ὑγρὸν ἰλυῶδες ἐκ τοῦ ἀγγείου εἰς τὴν φιάλην, παχὺ ὡς μέλι, ἀτμὸς ἀνῄει, οὐκ ἀτμός, καπνὸς φέρων μεθ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ ὀσμὴν ἥτις ἦν μέρος γῆς, μέρος θανάτου, μέρος τι ἄλλο παντελῶς, τι ὃ τὰς τρίχας τῆς ῥινός μου ἐποίησεν ἑλιχθῆναι αὐτοφύλακα.

Ὁ Σαμύιος ὤθησε τὴν φιάλην διὰ τῆς τραπέζης πρός με. Διεσύρθη διὰ στρώματος κονίας, ἴχνος γλοιῶδες καταλιποῦσα ὄπισθεν.

"Ἐπαυξάνει τὴν γλωσσικὴν ἀκριβολεξίαν," εἶπον, ῥοφήσας ἐκ τῆς κυλίκης.

"Οὐχ ὑπάρχει τοῦτο τὸ ὄνομα," ἀπεκρίνατο, τοῦ ποτοῦ αὐτοῦ κλυζομένου.

"Ἔστιν, ἐν γλώττῃ ἣν ἄρτι ἐποίησα" εἶπον, "ἀλλὰ ἔξεστι καὶ τῇ Θρομβολικῇ διαλέκτῳ ἀνήκειν, γλώττῃ λαλουμένῃ ὑπὸ τῶν ἰχθυανδρῶν τῆς Ὑφάλμυρου Θαλάσσης."

"Ὁ δακτύλιός μου ἀδρανεῖ ἐσχάτως, Σαμύιε," εἶπον, ἁρπάσας τὸν δακτύλιον μεταξὺ ἀντίχειρος καὶ δείκτου ὡς εἰ ἄνθραξ ζῶν ἦν. "Τὰς τελευταίας τρεῖς ἡμέρας, ἀφανίζει με εἰς τὸν τοιχοστόλισμον ὅτε πειρῶμαι ἄριστον ἐσθίειν. Φρόντισον, τὸ ὀπτὸν καὶ τὸ γλύκυμμα, ἡμιφάγον, καὶ παππαῖ, οὐκ εἰμὶ ἐκεῖ. Τὰ παστινάκιά μου ἐμείναντο ἐν τῷ ἀέρι, ἐρωτῶντα ποῦ ὁ δεσπότης αὐτῶν ἔφυγεν." Ἔκρουσα τὸν δακτύλιον ἐπὶ τῆς τραπέζης. "Ἐνιαυτὸν ἐφόρουν τὸν δακτύλιον ὡς δεύτερον δέρμα. Ἀλλὰ νῦν, ὀργίλος ἐστίν. Χθές, εἴασέ με ὁραθῆναι ὑπὸ κοράκου Σαμύιε! Αἱματοβόρου κορακοειδοῦς ὃς ἔκλεψέ μου τὸν πῖλον!"

Ὁ Σαμύιος ἀνέλαβε τὸν δακτύλιον, παρατηρῶν αὐτὸν ὡς μάγειρος ἐξετάζει κρέας ἀμφίβολον. Ἔστρεψεν αὐτόν. Ἐκράτησε πρὸς τὸ τοῦ λύχνου φῶς. Ἡ φλὸξ ἐκάμφθη περὶ αὐτόν.

"Φροδίων," εἶπεν, "τοῦτο τὸ σὸν πρᾶγμα, ἦλεκτρόνικόν ἐστιν, ἆρ᾽ οὔ; Περιφοράδας ἔχει. Μικροθαυματολογίαν. Ἴσως τρέχει ἐπὶ μικρῶν δαιμόνων ἐν πυριτίῳ φυλακισμένων. Οἱ δαίμονες ἐκεῖνοι ὀκνηροὶ γίνονται, ὅλον τὸ σύστημα πίπτει. Νευρόδεσμα καὶ τεχνίδια ἔχει ἃ οὐδὲ οἶδας;"

"Δοκῶ σοι μηχανοποιὸς εἶναι; Τί οἶδα περὶ τεχνομαγείας φλυαρώδους;" ἐμάχεσα, ῥάψας τὸν δακτύλιον ἐπὶ τὴν τράπεζαν. Ἐκυλίσθη ὡς κάνθαρος μεθύων. "Οὐκ ἔστιν ἀρτοφρύκτης, ὦ Σαμύιε. Ἔστι μηχάνιον ἐκ Μορδώρειας. Ἤκουσας Μορδώρειων ποτέ; Ποιοῦσιν ἰδιοποίητον μαγείαν τοῖς βουλομένοις ἀφανίζεσθαι."

Προσέκλινεν, ἡ πνοὴ αὐτοῦ ὀξεῖα μυκητοπότου. "Μορδώρεια; Ὡς ἐν, ἡ Μορδώρεια; Μελανομαγικὴ χειροτεχνία;"

"Ὡς ἐν ἡ μόνη ἑταιρεία ἡ πωλοῦσα πράγματα ἀνθρώποις οἳ οὐκ ἐρωτήσουσιν," εἶπον. "Ἡ ἀναγγελία ὑπέσχετο 'Ἀφάνεια Ἐγγυημένη'." Ἀνέλαβον τὸν δακτύλιον, ἔσχον πρὸς τὸ λυχνόφως. "Ὁ πωλητὴς εἶχεν ἄριστους ὀδόντας. Πειστικοὺς σφόδρα ὀδόντας."

"Ἴσως σε δεῖ τηλεφωνῆσαι αὐτοῖς. Ἴσως ὁ γρεμλίνος σου ἁπλῶς ὑποπρόγραμμα στερεῖται. Κάλεσον τὴν ἑταιρίαν. Εἰπὲ αὐτοῖς ὅτι ὁ δακτύλιός σου ἐλλιπής ἐστιν, ὅτι ποιεῖ τὴν ἀφάνειάν σου ἀσύμμετρον."

* 1 Κεφάλαιον Τρίτον: Ἡ Μορδώρεια Ἑταιρεία

Ὁ τηλέφωνος, θηρίον κυκλοφορικόν ὄν, ἐκάθητο ἐπὶ τῆς τραπέζης τοῦ Σαμυίου, μέλας βακελίτης, ὁ σπάρτος αὐτοῦ ἐντέροις ὅμοιος ἐστραμμένος, ὁ δέκτης βαρὺς ὡς ῥόπαλον κρανίοις πεποιημένον.

Ἐστρόφησα. Ἕκαστος ἀριθμὸς ὑπόσχεσις ἦν, ὁ δάκτυλός μου τὰς κυκλικὰς ὀπὰς πιέζων, ὁ μηχανισμὸς τὰ ἔγκατα ἑαυτοῦ ταράττων, ἑκάστη περιστροφὴ αἰὼν μικρός, κλικ κλικ κλικ, πέψις μηχανική τις, ὁ τροχὸς ἀναχωρῶν μετὰ τῆς ἀντιστάσεως δημίου ἀκουσίου.

Κωδωνισμός. Κωδωνισμός. Κωδωνισμός.

"Χαίρετε εἰς τὴν Μορδώρειον Συνδρομὴν Πελατῶν, ὅπου τὸ σκότος ὑμῶν ἡμέτερον ἔργον ἐστί," γυνή τις ἀντιπρόσωπος ἐξώλισθε διὰ τοῦ ἑτέρου πέρατος. Λεία ὡς ἀρσενικὸν ἐν μέλιτι. "Τοὔνομά μοι Λουργάθρα, τὸν λογαριασμοῦ ἀριθμόν, παρακαλῶ."

Ἐκάθηρα τὸν φάρυγγα, πτύελον ἐκεῖ κατασχόμενον ὡς μέτοικος ἀρνούμενος ἐξέλασιν. "Λόγος ἑπτακόσιοι ἑβδομήκοντα τρεῖς διὰ Β διὰ ἐννέα. Φροδίων Βάγγινς, ὠνητὴς ἑνὸς ἀοράτου δακτυλίου, τύπου Φασματοποιητικοῦ τρισχιλιοστοῦ, σειριακοῦ ἀριθμοῦ..."

"Ἔχω τὴν πινακίδα σου, ὦ Βάγγινς." Χάρται ἐτάραττοντο παρ' αὐτῇ, ὀξεῖς βίαιοι ψόφοι, ὡς ὀστέα ῥηγνύμενα τρόπῳ εὐτάκτῳ. "Πῶς ἂν σκοτίσαιμι τὴν ἡμέραν σου;"

"Ὁ δακτύλιός μου οὐχ ὑπηρετεῖ ὡς δεῖ καὶ χείρων γέγονε," ἀπεκρινάμην αὐτῇ, ἡ φωνὴ καταπίπτουσα εἰς συριγμὸν ψιθυριζόμενον. "Χθὲς πρωΐ, μέσῃ ἀφανείᾳ, ἐπάγην ἡμίσειος. Τὸ ἡμίσυ τὸ ἄνω ἀόρατον, οἰχόμενον, ἐκλελοιπὸς τὸν τόπον, τὸ ἡμίσυ τὸ κάτω φανερὸν ὡς χυλός. Τὰ σκέλη μου ἔμειναν ὄπισθεν. Ἐβάδιζον πρὸς τὴν ἑστίαν. Ἥψησαν τὸ τσάϊον. Ἐπλήττοντο. Ὁ θώραξ μου ἑώρταζεν εἰς τὴν μεταφυσικὴν χώραν, τὰ δὲ σφυρά μου ἐκίνουν τὴν χύτραν!"

Σιγή. Εἶτα φάρυγγος κάθαρσις, βὴξ ἐπαγγελματική.

"Ὦ Βάγγινε, ἐπιτρέψατέ μοι ἀναβαλεῖν σε στιγμὴν μίαν..."

"Μένε, μή..."

Μουσικὴ προσέβαλε τὸν ὠτὸς πόρον μου. Οὐ μουσική, τῷ ὄντι. Μέλη ἀναβατήριων συντεθειμένα ἐπί τινος ὡς ἔοικεν ἁρμονίου πεποιημένου ἐξ αἰλούρων ἐντέρων, λύραι πνιγόμεναι μέσῃ νότῃ, κιθάραι δακρύουσαι ἐλέου χάριν.

Ἔθλιψα τὸν δέκτην ἰσχυρότερον πρὸς τὸ κρανίον. Ὄπισθε τῆς μουσικῆς, φωναί. Ἡ φωνὴ αὐτῆς, νῦν ἀμυδρά, χεὶρ κεκαλυμμένη ἐπὶ τοῦ φωνηστομίου, φωναί τινες διερρέοντο. Χορὸς ὀρκικῶν ὀλολυγμῶν καὶ ἡ φωνὴ αὐτῆς, μακρὰν ἀλλ' ἀκουστή, προσφωνοῦσά τινα:

"Γρισνάκη! ΓΡΙΣΝΑΚΗ! Ὁ νέος ὄρκος, ὁ ἐκ τῆς Σειρᾶς Ἑβδόμης, τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐνεπάγη τῷ πυθμένι τοῦ λέβητος, ναί, τῷ πυθμένι, οὐχ ὁρᾷς οὗτος αἰσχίων ἔτι ἐστὶ τῶν λοιπῶν; Τί λέγεις 'ποῖος;' Ὁ κεκραγώς! Ναί, ἐκεῖνος. Οὔ, οὐ δυνάμεθα πωλεῖν αὐτὸν οὕτως. Οὐ μέλει μοι εἴ τις βούλοιτο ὄρκον ἐδαφοπρόσωπον, ἀπόλυσον αὐτὸν εἰς ἀμινοξέα καὶ ἐξ ἀρχῆς ποίησον. Χρῶ τῷ μεγάλῳ ἀγγείῳ. Τῷ βιομηχανικῷ ἀγγείῳ. Καὶ πρὸς τῆς τοῦ Σκοτεινοῦ Κυρίου φιλίας, τάραττε αὐτὸν τοῦτο τὸ χρόνον, μὴ μόνον ἐμβάλλε καὶ ἐλπίζε." Ὑγρὸς σαρκώδης ψόφος. "Ἆ ναί. Ὄγγ ὁ νέος χαλεπότητά τινα ἔχει." Κλαγγὴ μεταλλική. Ἄλλος χυλισμός. "Ἰδού. Πάντα βελτίω. Σῖγα. Ἀγαθὸς παῖς."

Ἔμεινα. Ὁ Σαμύιος ἐθεώρει, ῥοφῶν τὸ μυκητῶδες θείον ποτόν.

Ἡ μουσικὴ ἐκόπη. Ἡ φωνὴ αὐτῆς ἐπανῆλθε, λεία πάλιν.

"Εὐχαριστῶ σοι τῆς ἀναμονῆς, ὦ Βάγγινε. Συγγνώμην αἰτοῦμαι τῆς ἀναβολῆς. Πάσχομεν ὄγκους κλήσεων ὑψηλοτέρους τῶν συνήθων, καὶ προσέτι ἡ κατασκευαστικὴ ἡμῶν ψάμαθος πάσχει ὃ καλοῦμεν 'στιγμὴν ἀναδομήσεως προϊόντων. '"

"Περὶ τοῦ δακτυλίου μου..." ἠρξάμην.

"Ναί. Τὸ δίχα ὁρατότητος πρόβλημά σου. Ἀνέσπασα τὰ δεδομένα τοῦ δακτυλίου σου. Τύπος Φασματοποιητικὸς τρισχιλιοστός, ὠνηθεὶς πρὸ ὀκτωκαίδεκα μηνῶν, ἐγγύησις ἐκλελοιπυῖα..."

"Ἐκλελοιπυῖα; Ἔδωκα νόμισμα ἀγαθὸν τῆς παρατεταμένης ἐγγυήσεως! Ὁ πωλητὴς τοῖς ἄριστοις ὀδοντοῦσιν, ὑπέσχετο..."

"Ὦ Βάγγινε." Ἡ φωνὴ αὐτῆς ὠξύνθη, μάχαιρα σπασθεῖσα ἐκ βελουδίνου κολεοῦ. "Ἡ παρατεταμένη ἐγγύησις καλύπτει ἀποτυχίαν καταστροφικήν, οὐ φθορὰν ἀποδόσεως. Ὃ πάσχεις κέκληται 'φάσις ἀνώμαλος,' ἥτις πίπτει ὑπὸ τρῖψιν συνήθη."

"Κοινήν;" ἐβόησα, Σαμύιος πηδήσας ἐπὶ τοῦ μακροῦ τῆς τραπέζης τέρματος, τὸ μυκητικὸν αὐτοῦ τσάϊον κλυζόμενον.

"Κύριε, ταπείνωσον τὴν φωνήν, παρακαλῶ. Συνίημι τὴν ἀγανάκτησίν σου. Ὅμως, τὰ ἐκτελεστικᾶς περιβαλλούσης γράμματα τοῦ δακτυλίου οὐκ εἰσὶ διαθέσιμα τῷ χρωμένῳ. Τὰ ἐντὸς ἔργα τοῦ δακτυλίου σου, ὁ διαγνωστικὸς καταρράκτης, ὁ θαυματουργικὸς σωρὸς ἰχνῶν, πάντα ἀνήκει τῇ Μορδωρείᾳ Βιομηχανίᾳ. Τοῦτο ἐπιτήδευμα ἀσφαλείας ἐστὶν εἰς κώλυσιν ἀντιμηχανολογίας τῶν ἰδιωτικῶν ἡμῶν ἀλγορίθμων ἀοράτου."

Ἔθλιψα τὸν δεκτῆρα, οἱ κόνδυλοι λευκαινόμενοι, φαντασθεὶς αὐτὸν τὸν τράχηλον αὐτῆς εἶναι, οὔ, οὔ, οὐ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτῆς, τὸν τοῦ ἐμπορικοῦ τράχηλον, οἱ ἄριστοι ἐκεῖνοι ὀδόντες τρίζοντες ὡς ἔπνιγον αὐτόν. "Ἐπιτήδευμα ἀσφαλείας; Οὐδὲ ὁρᾶν δύναμαι τί λελωβημένον ἐστὶν τῷ ἰδίῳ μου δακτυλίῳ;"

"Ὀρθῶς. Τὰ γράμματα κεκρυπτογραφημένα εἰσὶν ἑπτακαίδεκα φοράς, χρώμενα δαιμονικοῖς κρύφοις οἵτινες ὑγροποιήσουσι τὸν ἐγκέφαλόν σου εἰ πειράσαις ἀναγνῶναι αὐτά. Τοῦτο πρὸς τὴν σὴν προστασίαν ἐστίν, ὦ Βάγγινε."

"Τὴν ἐμὴν προστασίαν." Ἐγέλασα, ὁ ψόφος ἀναξυόμενος τὸν φάρυγγα ὡς χάλιξ διὰ ὀχετηροῦ. "Ἡμιαόρατός εἰμι Τρίτῃ πρωΐ, καταπλήσσων τὸν γαλακτοπώλην εἰς καρδιακὴν ἀποπληξίαν, καὶ σύ με προστατεύεις;"

"Κύριε, δύναμαι τάξαι διαγνωστικὴν συνάντησιν. Ἡ προσεχὴς διαθέσιμος χάσμη ἐστίν..." χάρται πάλιν ταρασσόμενοι, ἐκεῖνος ὁ τῶν ὀστέων ῥηγμοῦ ψόφος, "...ἓξ ἑβδομάδας ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν, Τρίτῃ ἀπογεύματι, μεταξὺ τῆς δευτέρας καὶ ἕκτης ὥρας. Τις ἀφίξεται ἐξετάσων τὸν δακτύλιόν σου. Ὑπηρεσίας μισθὸς ἐστι τεσσαράκοντα χρυσοῖ νομίσματα, οὐκ ἀποδοτέον, πληρωτέον προκαταβολῇ."

"Ἓξ ἑβδομάδες; Τεσσαράκοντα χρυσοῖ νομίσματα;"

"Ἐναλλακτικῶς," συνέχισε, φωνὴ λεία ὡς ὁμολογία ἐξελθοῦσα ὑπὸ βίᾳ, "δύναιο ὠνήσασθαι τὸν νέον ἡμῶν τύπον, τὸν Φασματοποιητικὸν τετρακισχιλιοστόν. Ἔχει βελτιωμένην φασικὴν σταθερότητα, μειωμένην φασματικὴν διάρροιαν, καὶ δωρεὰν κατάρας ἀφαίρεσιν τὸν πρῶτον μῆνα."

"Βούλει με ὨΝΗΣΑΣΘΑΙ ἈΛΛΟΝ ΔΑΚΤΥΛΙΟΝ;"

"Ὁ Εἰδωλοποιὸς Τρισχίλιοι κληρονομικὸν προϊὸν ἐστιν, ὦ Βάγγινε. Οὐκέτι κατασκευάζομεν ἀντικατάστατα μέρη. Ἐν τινι καιρῷ, ἡ ἀναβάθμισις οἰκονομικωτέρα γίνεται τῆς ἐπισκευῆς."

* 1 Κεφάλαιον Δ': Ὁ Ἄρχων τῆς Σαυρίου Μορδώρειας

"Πρόπεμψόν με," ἐβρύχησα εἰς τὸν ὑποδοχέα. "Πρὸς τὸν ἐπιστάτην σου. Νῦν. Παραχρῆμα."

Σιγή, κύουσα τῷ βάρει χιλίων γραφειοκρατικῶν ἁμαρτημάτων.

"Ὦ Βάγγινε κύριε..."

"Πρόπεμψόν. Με."

Στεναγμὸς διέρρευσεν διὰ τῆς φωνοφόρου γραμμῆς, πνεῦμα φεῦγον ἐκ νεκροῦ τελευταίας ἐκπνοῆς. "Μίαν στιγμὴν παρακαλῶ."

"Οὗτός ἐστι Σαύριος. Ἄρχων, Μορδώρειας Ἐργαστήρια."

"Σαύριε. Ὁ Σαύριος; Ὀφθαλμὸς φλογός, χαλκεὺς τῶν..."

"Ναὶ ναὶ ναί, πάντα λίαν κινηματογραφικά, ἡ σημειοποιητικὴ συνομοσπονδία μου ὑπερέβαλεν ἑαυτοὺς ἐκείνῃ τῇ δημοσιονομικῇ ὥρᾳ, μισθοδοτήματα πᾶσιν, οἰνοκρῆναι καὶ τὰ ἑξῆς καὶ τὰ ἑξῆς." Ἡ φωνὴ αὐτοῦ ἐκυλίετο ὡς λίθοι κατὰ ὄρους. "Νῦν δέ. Ὁ δακτύλιός σου. Ὁ Φασματοποιητὴς Γ'. Ἀριθμὸς χαραχθεὶς ἐν πυρὶ Ὄρους Δαίμονος, ψυχθεὶς ἐν αἵματι προδεδομένων χαλκέων. Τί κακοτεχνεῖ;"

"Χθὲς τὰ σκέλη μου τὸν θεῖον οἶνον ἐσκεύαζον, ἐν ᾧ ὁ θώραξ μου τὸν ἀστρικὸν τόπον ἐξηρεύνα. Τῇ πρότερον, ἐπτάρην καὶ ἡ κεφαλή μου ἠφανίσθη, ἀλλὰ τὸ σῶμα ἔμεινεν, βαδίζον εἰς τοίχους ὡς ἀποκεφαλισμένη ὄρνις, προσπίπτον εἰς τὰ ἔπιπλα, φοβερὸν τοῖς γείτοσιν." Ἐψέλλισα.

"Μμμ." Βρόντημα, ἡφαιστειῶδες, ἠπειρωτικὴ πλάξ βουλευομένη εἰ σχίσει. "Κλασσικὴ φθορὰ τῆς στερεογραφῆς. Οἱ δαίμονες οἱ κινοῦντες τὸν κεντρικὸν λογιστὴν τοῦ δακτυλίου σου, μικροὶ βάσταρδοι εἰσίν, ῥᾳθυμοῦσιν. Συμβαίνει. Ἡ περίπτωσίς σου οὐκ ἔστιν ἰδιάζουσα. Ἔχομεν πελάτας οἵτινες ἀφανίζονται τρισσῶς. Πελάτας οἵτινες ἐγείρονται ἄνω κάτω, ἢ ἔσω ἔξω, ἢ μόνον πλατεῖς ὡς πλακοῦντες. Δυστυχὲς ἀλλὰ ἀναπόφευκτον."

"Ἀναπόφευκτον;" Ἐβόησα, τῆς Σαμυίου κύλικος σειομένης κατὰ τῆς πατάνης, τῶν μυκήτων ἐν τῷ κάτω οἰκήματι ἴσως πτησσόντων. "Ἀναπόφευκτον; Χρυσὸν ἀγαθὸν ἔδωκα ὑπὲρ τούτου τοῦ δακτυλίου! Ὁ ἀγοραστής, οἱ ὀδόντες αὐτοῦ, ὑπέσχετο..."

"Οἱ ἀγορασταὶ πολλὰ ὑπισχνοῦνται, ὦ Βάγγινε." Ἡ φωνὴ τοῦ Σαυρίου διέρρει διὰ τῆς φωνοφόρου γραμμῆς, μέλι μεμιγμένον ὑελίνῃ κόνει. "Ὑπισχνοῦνται αἰωνιότητα. Ὑπισχνοῦνται τελειότητα. Ὑπισχνοῦνται, ὠνήσασθαι ἅπαξ, ἔχειν μαγείαν ἀεί, ὅπερ, εἰλικρινῶς, ἐν τῇ σῇ περιπτώσει προφανῶς τὸ κύριον πωλητικὸν σημεῖον ἦν, ἦ γάρ;"

"Ἀλλὰ ἐρωτῶ· Πῶς δεῖ με διορθῶσαι αὐτόν, εἰ μὴ δύναμαι ὁρᾶν πῶς ἐργάζεται, εἰ μὴ δύναμαι διαγιγνώσκειν τὸν ἐμαυτοῦ κόσμημα;" Ἐβόησα, τὸν ὑποδοχέα πιέζων οὕτω σφόδρα πρὸς τὸ κρανίον μου ὡς προφανῶς μώλωπα κυκλικὸν ἕξειν αὔριον. "Εἰ τὰ ἔγκατα τούτου τοῦ πράγματος ἀνήκουσι Μορδώρειᾳ Ἐργαστηρίοις, τίς κέκτηται αὐτόν; Ἐγώ; Ἢ σύ;" "Εἰ τὰ ἔγκατα τούτου τοῦ πράγματος ἀνήκουσι τοῖς Μορδώρειας Ἐργαστηρίοις, τότε τίς κύριός ἐστιν αὐτοῦ; Ἐγώ; Ἢ σύ;"

Ὁ γέλως τοῦ Σαυρίου ἐξέρραγεν, οὐ χαρά, ἀλλὰ νίκη, ψόφος ὑπομιμνῄσκων με στρατευμάτων διαβαινόντων διὰ καιομένων κωμῶν, κοράκων ἑστιωμένων ἐπὶ μαχητικῶν νεκρῶν, νικητηρίων σημείων πεπηγμένων ἐν κρανίοις τῶν νενικημένων. "Κέκτησαι αὐτόν, ὦ Φροδίων Βάγγινε; Ἢ μόνον ἔχεις αὐτόν;"

"Τοῦτο, τοῦτο τὸ αὐτό ἐστιν!"

"Ἠγόρασας τὸν δακτύλιον, ναί;" Ὁ Σαύριος ἐσπάραξεν, "Οὐ συνίεις τὴν φύσιν τῆς κυριότητος ἐν τῇ νεωτέρᾳ ἐποχῇ. Ἠγόρασας τὸν δακτύλιον, ναί; Χρυσὸς μετεδόθη, συμβόλαιον ὑπεγράφη, ἴσως ἐν αἵματι, ἴσως ἐν μέλανι, οἱ λογισταὶ οὐ προσδιορίζουσιν. Κύριός εἶ τοῦ φυσικοῦ ἀντικειμένου, τῆς μεταλλικῆς περιόχου στρεβλούσης τὴν διαστατικὴν εὐστάθειαν τῶν ἀναξυρίδων σου. Τοῦτό ἐστι σόν."

"Μεμίσθωται," ἐπανέλαβον.

"Ἀλλά!" Ἡ λέξις ἐξέρραγεν διὰ τῆς φωνοφόρου γραμμῆς, θραύσματα συλλαβῶν, ὁ Σαμύιος ἐκύπτησεν ὡς ὑπὸ ἐπερχομένῳ πυροβολικῷ. "Τὸ λογισμικόν! Τὰ τῆς ἀφανίσεως πρωτόκολλα! Ἡ δαιμονικὴ ἀρχιτεκτονικὴ τροφοδοτοῦσα τὴν ἐξαφάνισίν σου—τοῦτο, Βαγγίνε, μεμίσθωσαι. Ἀορίστως, ναί, διὰ τῆς διαρκείας τοῦ φυσικοῦ σου βίου καὶ μικρῷ πέραν, ἀλλὰ μεμίσθωσαι ὅμως. Κέκτησαι τὸν δακτύλιον.  Ἡμεῖς κεκτήμεθα τὴν μαγείαν ἐν αὐτῷ."

"Καὶ ταῦτα τὰ ἀναγραφεῖα, ἡ διαγνωστικὴ κατάρρησις, τὸ θαυματουργικὸν ἴχνος σωροῦ; Σύ, Φροδίων Βάγγινε, πολίτης χόββιτος, θέλεις ἀποβλέψαι εἰς τὰ ἔγκατα ἰδιόκτητης τεχνολογίας χιλιετηρίδας ἐπινοηθείσης; Τεχνολογίας ἥτις ἐκόστισε μυριάδας ἐν ἐρεύνῃ, ἐν θυσίᾳ κυριολεκτικῇ, ἐν αἵματι ἐκχυθέντι μετρηθέντι κατὰ τὸν ὠκεανόν;"

"Ὁ δακτύλιος μένει σός, ὦ Βάγγινε. Ἡ ἀφάνισις, ὅμως, ἐκείνην μόνον δανείζομεν. Ἀορίστως, ναί, ἀιδίως ἐνίοτε, ἀλλὰ δανείζομεν. Ἔχεις ἄδειαν. Ἀμετάκλητον, οὐ μεταβιβαστήν, δεσμευτικὴν μέχρι θανάτου καὶ ἔτι πλέον. Ἐὰν παραβῇς τοὺς ὅρους τῆς ὑπηρεσίας, ἀντιμηχανολογῇς τὰς ἐπῳδάς, μεταδιδῷς τὰς μαγικὰς φωνάς, ἐπιχειρῇς λύειν τὴν κατάραν, διατηροῦμεν τὸ δικαίωμα ἀπενεργοποιῆσαι τηλεβόλως τὰ μεμισθωμένα σου χαρακτηριστικά. Καταλειφθήσῃ μετὰ κύκλου μετάλλου λίαν πολυτελοῦς, λίαν ἀχρήστου."

"Ἆρα τοῦτο νόμιμόν ἐστιν;"

"Τελείως νόμιμον," ἔφριξεν ὁ Σαύριος, αἴλουρος ἱκανοποιηθεὶς μετὰ καναρίου κατάπωσιν. "Ῥῆτρα ἑπτακαιδεκάτη, ὑποδιαίρεσις Β', παράγραφος ἐνάτη. 'Ὁ χρήστης ὁμολογεῖ ὅτι ἡ τῆς ἀφανίσεως λειτουργικότης συνιστᾷ μεμισθωμένην νοητικὴν ἰδιοκτησίαν καὶ μένει ἰδιοκτησία μόνη τῶν Μορδώρειας Ἐργαστηρίων εἰς τὸ διηνεκὲς συν ἑβδομήκοντα ἔτεσιν, ὁπότερον ἔλθῃ ὕστερον. ' Τοῦτο ἐσφράγισας, ὦ Βάγγινε. Ἡ ὑπογραφή σου κεῖται ἐν τῷ ἡμετέρῳ θησαυροφυλακίῳ, τετηρημένη ἐν ἠλέκτρῳ, φυλασσομένη ὑπὸ Βαλρώγων."

"Ἐὰν παραβῇς τοὺς ὅρους τῆς ὑπηρεσίας, ἀντιμηχανολογῇς τὰς ἐπῳδάς, μεταδιδῷς τὰς γοητείας, πειρᾶσαι θραῦσαι τὴν κατάραν, τιθῇς τὸν πηγαῖον κώδικα ἐν δημοσίοις φόροις ἄλλοις δυσαρέστοις, τηροῦμεν τὸ δικαίωμα, ὦ Βάγγινε, ἀπομάκροθεν ἀπενεργοποιῆσαι τὰ μεμισθωμένα σου χαρακτηριστικά."

"Δύνασθε κλεῖσαι αὐτόν;"

"Μετὰ νοήματος. Μετὰ ὑπομνήματος. Μετὰ σημείου ἐν τύπῳ ἐργαζομένῳ ὑπὸ τοῦ Νομικοῦ Τμήματος, Τρίτου Ὀρόφου, Δυτικῆς Πτέρυγος, ἡ Κάρολα χειρίζεται ἐκεῖνα, φίλη γυνή, ποιεῖ ἐξαίρετα μικρὰ ἄρτα, πλακοῦντα, ταῖς γραφειακαῖς ἑορταῖς. Ἓν σημεῖον, ὦ Βάγγινε, καὶ ὁ δακτύλιός σου γίγνεται κόσμημα. Μοδάτος, ἴσως. Λαμπρός, βεβαίως. Λειτουργικόν;" Ἐπαύσατο, ἀφεὶς τὴν λέξιν κρέμασθαι ὡς βρόχον. "Οὔ."

"Ἔχομεν συνέσιν, ὦ Βάγγινε;"

Ἐνεῦσα, συνεῖδον ὅτι οὐκ ἐδύνατο ὁρᾶν, ἔκραξα, "Ναί."

"Θαυμάσιον. Εὐχαριστῶ ὅτι ἐξέλεξας Μορδώρας Ἐργαστήρια, ἔνθα τὸ σκότος σου ἐστὶν ἡ ἡμετέρα ἐργασία. Ἔχε ἡμέραν."

Κλικ.

Ἡ γραμμὴ ἀπέθανεν.

"Φροδίων," εἶπεν ἠρέμα ὁ Σάμυιος, "νομίζω δεῖ σε πλείονος μυκητικοῦ οἴνου."

Ἐνεῦσα. Οἱ λόγοι ἐγκατέλειψάν με. Ὁ λογισμὸς ἔφυγεν κεκραγώς.

Ἐν πύργῳ μέλανος λίθου καὶ λογιστικῶν φύλλων, ὁ Σαύριος ἐπέστρεψεν εἰς τὴν χαρτουργίαν αὐτοῦ, ἄλλη ψυχὴ δεδεμένη οὐχὶ κατάραις ἀλλὰ συμβολαίοις, πολλῷ μονιμωτέροις, πολλῷ ὠμοτέροις.

Ὁ ὑποδοχεὺς ἐκάθισεν βαρὺς ἐν τῇ χειρί μου. Διὰ τῆς θυρίδος, κόραξ κατέπτη, ἔκλινε τὴν κεφαλήν, κρίνων με ὀφθαλμοῖς οἵτινες ἑώρακον ταύτην τὴν συνομιλίαν διαδραματισθεῖσαν χιλιάκις πρότερον, ἐν χιλίαις διαφόροις οἰκίαις, μετὰ χιλίων διαφόρων ἠπατημένων κρατούντων τηλεφωνοφόρους καὶ συνιδόντων ὀψέ τι ὅτι ἐπράθησαν ἔλαιον ὄφεων ὑπὸ ἀνδρὸς μετὰ ὡραίων ὀδόντων. Οὕτως ὡραίων ὀδόντων!

* 1 Κεφάλαιον Ε': Γάνδαλφος καὶ ὁ ἵππος αὐτοῦ

Ἡ θυρίς, ῥυπαρὰ οὖσα, ἐδήλου μοι κίνησιν, καὶ ψόφος ὁπλῶν ἐπὶ χαλίκων ἀνήγγειλε προσιόντα τινά.

Ἵππος, λευκός, μονόφθαλμος, προσέδραμε κατὰ τὴν ὁδόν, ὥσπερ θανάτου γαμήλιον ἅρμα, πᾶς ὀστέον καὶ μῦς καὶ συνταξία, αἱ ὁπλαὶ αὐτοῦ κρούουσαι πρὸς τὸν λίθον, κλόπ θούδ κλόπ, ῥυθμὸς ἀνώμαλος, τὸ θηρίον εὐλαβούμενον τὴν ἀριστερὰν πρόσθιον σκέλος. Ὀφθαλμὸν ἕνα εἶχεν, τοῦ ἀριστεροῦ κόγχου κενοῦ ὄντος, συμπεπτωκότος εἴσω, κρατῆρός τινος. Ὁ λοιπὸς ὀφθαλμὸς ἐστρέφετο, μέγας ὡς ᾠὸν ἡψημένον, ἐπισκοπῶν τὸν κόσμον.

Γάνδαλφος ἐφ' αὐτῷ ἐκάθητο, ὁ πώγων αὐτοῦ καταρρέων, ὁ καταρράκτης τῆς κόμης αὐτοῦ ἄγριος γεγονὼς καὶ λευκὸς ὡς ὕδωρ πλυνοῦ, αἱ στολαὶ αὐτοῦ ῥιπιζόμεναι.

"Σαμύιε," ἔσυρισα, "Γάνδαλφος ἔξω ἐστίν."

"Γάνδαλφος;" Ἡ κεφαλὴ Σαμυίου ἐστράφη ὀξέως, τὸ τσάϊον αὐτοῦ κυμαινόμενον. "Ὁ μάγος Γάνδαλφος; Ἐνθάδε; Νῦν;"

Ἐξεπέσομεν ἔξω, ὁ ἵππος ἔστη. Ἐπνέει βαρέως, οἱ μυκτῆρες αὐτοῦ διαστελλόμενοι, ἡ πνοὴ αὐτοῦ ἀτμίζουσα ἐν τῷ ἀέρι, ὃς οὐκ ἔδει ψυχρὸς εἶναι ἀλλ' ἦν ὅμως.

Κατέβη, ὁ ἵππος ἐφρύαξεν, ὁ μόνος ἐκεῖνος ὀφθαλμὸς στρεφόμενος.

"Τί τὸ πρόβλημα δοκεῖ εἶναι, Φροδίων;" Γάνδαλφος προσῆλθεν.

"Ὁ δακτύλιός μου," ἠρξάμην. "Ἠγόρασα αὐτὸν ἀπὸ τῆς Καπηλείας τοῦ Ἀδελφιδοῦ Βίλβωνος, παρὰ τὸ τμῆμα τῶν ἐλφικῶν κτενῶν, οἶσθα τὸν τόπον; Πωλοῦσι δακτυλίους ἀοράτου ποιήσεως, νομίμους..."

"Νομίμους," ἐφρύαξεν Γάνδαλφος, ὁ ψόφος ὥσπερ φρύαγμα ἵππου, καταφρονητικός, ἀρχαῖος.

"...μετὰ γραμμάτων προειδοποιητικῶν! Ἐπαγγελματικῶν γραμμάτων προειδοποιητικῶν! 'Χρῶ τῷδε τῷ δακτυλίῳ μόνον εἰ μὴ σέβῃ χρόνον, χῶρον. '"

"Καὶ δή;" Γάνδαλφος ἐπερείσατο τῇ βακτηρίᾳ αὐτοῦ, τὸ βάρος μετατιθείς, ἀναμένων.

"Καὶ κακῶς λειτουργεῖ! Χθὲς τὰ σκέλη μου ἐβάδιζε χωρὶς τοῦ θώρακός μου. Σήμερον; Σήμερον, Γάνδαλφε, ἔμυσα καὶ ὁ ἀριστερὸς βραχίων μου ἠφανίσθη ἐπὶ ἓξ λεπτά. Ἕξ! Οἶσθα πόσον χαλεπόν ἐστιν ἄλειψιν ἄρτου βουτύρῳ χειρὶ μιᾷ ὅταν ὁ ἀπολωλὼς βραχίων ὁ κύριός ἐστιν;"

Ὁ πώγων Γανδάλφου ἔσπασεν, ἴσως μειδίαμα ἦν, ἴσως δυσχέρεια. "Ἐτηλεφώνησας τῷ τεχνίτῃ."

Οὐκ ἐρώτησις. Ἀπόφανσις. ἬΙδει.

"Μορδώρειᾳ Βιομηχανίαις. Διελέχθην Σαύριῳ αὐτῷ. Ἐκεῖνος ἐδήλωσέ μοι..." Ἔπτυσα τοὺς λόγους, ἰῷ μεμιγμένους, χόλῳ βεβαμμένους, "...ὅτι κέκτημαι τὸν δακτύλιον ἀλλὰ μισθοῦμαι τὴν ἀοράτου ποίησιν. Ὅτι ἡ μαγεία ἔνδον ἀνήκει αὐτοῖς. Εἰς ἀεί. Διηνεκῶς. Ὅτι δύνανται ἀποκινεῖν αὐτὴν τηλόθεν ἐὰν παραβαίνω τοὺς ὅρους ὑπηρεσίας οὓς οὐκ ἀνέγνων διότι τίς ἀναγιγνώσκει ὅρους ὑπηρεσίας;"

"Πάντας δεῖ," Γάνδαλφος ἐψιθύρισεν, "ἀλλ' οὐδεὶς ποιεῖ. Μῦθος παλαιὸς ὡς χρόνος, ἐκεῖνος."

Σαμύιος ἐφθέγξατο, φωνῇ μυὸς τρίζοντος, "Ἔξω ἑαυτοῦ ἐστιν, Γάνδαλφε. Κυρίως λελυμένος. Πέπωκε τὸ μυκητῶδες θεῖόν μου καὶ ἑλίσσεται περὶ κτήσεως πρὸς κατοχὴν καὶ..."

"Τί δὲ σύ, Γάνδαλφε;" ἠρώτησα, "Διὰ τί ἐλαύνεις τοῦτο τὸ κυκλωπικὸν βδέλυγμα ἀντὶ ὀχήματός τινος εὐλόγου;"

Ὁ ἵππος πάλιν ἐφρύαξεν, ἴσως προσβληθείς, ὁ μόνος ἐκεῖνος ὀφθαλμὸς συσταλλόμενος.

"Ἀνακαίνισις," Γάνδαλφος ἐβρύχησεν, ὁ λόγος ἀποδακνόμενος ὀξέως. "Λογισμάτων ἀνακαίνισις. Αὐτοκίνητος λογισμάτων ἀνακαίνισις κατεστήσατο ἑαυτὴν διὰ τῆς νυκτὸς ὅτε τὸ ὄχημά μου ἐκάθητο φορτιζόμενον. Μεσονύκτιον. Οὐδεμία προειδοποίησις. Οὐδεμία συγκατάθεσις. Μόνον πινγκ, 'Ἀνακαίνισις ἑτοίμη, καθισταμένη νῦν, μὴ ἀποσυνδέσῃς δύναμιν, τοῦτο λήψεται πεντεκαίδεκα λεπτά. '"

"Πεντεκαίδεκα λεπτά;" Σαμύιος ἤρετο.

"Ἑπτακαίδεκα ὥρας," Γάνδαλφος ἐβρόντησεν, ἡ βακτηρία παίουσα γῆν, σπινθῆρες πετόμενοι, σπινθῆρες ἀληθινοί, μικρὰ πυρὰ ταχέως ἀποθνῄσκοντα. "Ἑπτακαίδεκα ὧραι τοῦ 'Βελτιοῦμεν συστηματικὴν ἐνέργειαν, παρακαλῶ ἀναμεῖνον. ' Ἦλθεν ἕως. Ἀνέτειλεν ἥλιος, ὄρνιθες ᾖσαν τὰς μωρὰς αὐτῶν ᾠδάς. Ὄχημα ἔτι βελτιοῦν. Ἔτι ἀναμένον. Ἐσκεψάμην τὰ συνέδρια..."

"Συνέδρια;" Ἐπέκαρον.

"Μαγικὰ συνέδρια. Τεχνικὴν βοήθειαν τοῖς μαγικῶς ἐνδιαφερομένοις. Φαίνεται αὕτη ἡ ἀνακαίνισις, ἔκδοσις 7.4.2, πλινθοποιεῖ ὀχήματα κατασκευασθέντα πρὸ τοῦ Ἔτους τῆς Ἐστραμμένης Σελήνης. Πλινθοποιεῖ αὐτά. Ἀκινητοποιεῖ αὐτὰ τελείως. Οὐκ ἄρχεται. Οὐ φορτίζεται. Μόνον κάθηται ἐκεῖ, κόσμημα προαυλείου."

"Ὥστε ἐλαύνεις..." Ἐνεῦσα πρὸς τὸν ἵππον.

"Μάγνος," Γάνδαλφος εἶπεν. "Τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐστι Μάγνος. Μονόφθαλμος λευκὸς ἵππος. Ἐδεόμην μεταφορᾶς, ἐκεῖνος ἐδεῖτο σκοποῦ."

Μάγνος ἐπάταξε ὁπλήν, ὁ μόνος ὀφθαλμὸς στηριζόμενος ἐπ' ἐμέ, ἡ κόρη αὐτοῦ διασταλλομένη, συσταλλομένη, ἀνησυχητικῷ ὑπνωτικῷ ῥυθμῷ.

"Πόσον χρόνον ἕως τὸ ὄχημά σου ἰαθῇ;" Σαμύιος ἐτόλμησεν.

"Ἡ τεχνικὴ βοήθεια λέγει ἐπιδιόρθωσιν ἐρχομένην τὴν ἑπομένην ἑβδομάδα. Ἴσως. Δυνατῶς. 'Ταχέως. ' Οἶσθα πῶς ταῦτα βαίνει. Μεταξύ, ἐλαύνω Μάγνον. Συνδεόμεθα. Ἀνέχεταί με. Νῦν. Περὶ τοῦ δακτυλίου σου. Δεῖξόν μοι αὐτόν."

Ἐξεῖλκυσα τὸν δακτύλιον ἐκ κόλπου, ἐξέτεινα αὐτόν, ὁ χαλκὸς λαβὼν φῶς κακῶς, κάμπτων αὐτό, διαστρέφων αὐτό, ἡ ὑπαρκτικὴ κυμαινομένη περὶ τὴν περιφέρειαν.

Γάνδαλφος ἔλαβεν αὐτόν, κατέσχεν αὐτὸν ἐγγύς, ὀφθαλμῷ διακρίνων, ἑτέρῳ ὀφθαλμῷ διαφόρως διακρίνων, ἐξετάζων, ἐρευνῶν, ψιθυρίζων λόγους οὓς οὐκ ἐγνώριζον, ἴσως οὐκ ἔδει γνωρίζειν.

"Μμμ," τέλος εἶπεν. "Ναί. Ὄντως φαῦλος. Ὄντως κατηραμένος. Πάντως παραβαίνων ἑπτακοσίους περίπου κανόνας περὶ διαστατικῆς χειρισμοῦ. Εὐτυχὴς εἶ ὅτι οὔπω διεφάσισας διὰ τοῦ πλανητικοῦ πυρῆνος."

"Δύνασαι ἰάσασθαι αὐτόν;"

Ἔρριψε τὸν δακτύλιον πάλιν. Ἔλαβον αὐτόν, ἐψηλάφησα, μικροῦ κατέβαλον αὐτόν.

"Οὔ, Φροδίων. Οὐ δύναμαι ἰάσασθαι αὐτόν. Οὐδεὶς δύναται ἰάσασθαι αὐτὸν ἄνευ τοῦ ἴχνους ἐκτελέσεως, διότι ἡ ἴασις κοστίζει μόνον τὰ μέρη ἀντικαταστάσεως καὶ τὸ πωλεῖν σοι νέον πρότυπον ποιεῖ πλείονα χρήματα. Ἁπλῆ οἰκονομία. Παλαιὰ ὡς δράκοντες θησαυρίζοντες χρυσόν. Παλαιοτέρα."

Μάγνος ἐχρεμέτισεν, ἴσως συμφωνῶν, ἢ πεινῶν. Χαλεπὸν εἰπεῖν μετὰ μονοφθάλμων ἵππων.

Σαμύιος ἐψιθύρισέ τι περὶ "οὐ τοῦτο πάλιν" καὶ ἀνεχώρησεν εἰς τὸν κατώγειον.

* 1 Κεφάλαιον ἕκτον: Ἱππασία εἰς Μορδώρεια

"Μορδώρεια," ἀνεφώνησεν ὁ Γάνδαλφος, τὴν βακτηρίαν ὀρθὴν πήξας ὥσπερ σημεῖον ἐν κατακτήτῳ γῇ. Τὸ ὄνομα ἐκεῖ ἔμεινε, παχὺ καὶ τελειωτικόν. "Βαδίζομεν πρὸς τὸ ἀρχεῖον αὐτῶν. Τὸν ὑάλινον πύργον, ἐν τῇ ἀγορανομικῇ χώρᾳ, τῷ ἑβδόμῳ καὶ τριακοστῷ ὀρόφῳ."

"Σκώπτεις," εἶπον, ἀλλ᾽ ὁ πώγων αὐτοῦ ἐγεγόνει στερεός, αἱ τρίχες ἠλεκτρισμέναι μετὰ σκοποῦ. Οὐδέποτε σκώπτει ὁ Γάνδαλφος, οὐ περὶ συνεταιρισμῶν, οὐ περὶ πύργων οἳ τὸν οὐρανὸν ξύουσι καὶ τμήματα ἔχουσιν ὀνομαζόμενα "Ὑπηρεσία Πελατῶν."

"Ἀντιβλέποντες αὐτοὺς πρόσωπον πρὸς πρόσωπον," ἐβρόντησεν, τὴν βακτηρίαν πήξας, ἑκάστη συλλαβὴ λίθος ῥιφθεὶς εἰς ὕδωρ ἥσυχον. "Ὀφθαλμὸς πρὸς ὀφθαλμόν. Βούλει διαγνωστικὰ δεδομένα; Βούλει ἐκτελεστικὰς ἀποδείξεις; Βούλεις αὐτοὺς ἀνοῖξαι τὸ ἴδιον θησαυροφυλάκιον καὶ ἐκχέαι μυστήρια; Αἱ δι᾽ ἀκουστικοῦ κλήσεις οὐδαμόσε σε ἄγουσιν. Αἱ ἐπιστολαὶ ἠλεκτρονικαὶ ἀφανίζονται εἰς θυλάκους ἀχρήστων φυλασσομένους ὑπὸ Ναζγούλων. Ἀλλ᾽ ἡ παρουσία, τὸν ἀναψυκτὸν αὐτῶν ἀέρα πνέων, ἐν τῷ προστῴῳ ἱστάμενος μετὰ φυτῶν ἐν ἀγγείοις ἀποθνῃσκόντων βραδέως ὑπὸ φωσφορίζοντα φῶτα, τοῦτο αὐτοὺς ἄβολον ποιεῖ."

Ὁ Μάγνος ἐπάταξε τὴν γῆν, ἡ ὁπλὴ τύπτουσα τὴν γῆν, ὁ μονώνυξ ὀφθαλμὸς αὐτοῦ, μέγας ὡς ᾠὸν ἑφθὸν ἐν ἅλμῃ πολὺν χρόνον λειφθέν, ἐστράφη καὶ εἰς ἐμὲ ἐπάγη. Ἡ κρίσις ἦν ὠμή. Ὁ λογισμὸς ἦν ἀνελεήμων.

"Ἀμφότεροι;" ἠρόμην. Ἡ φωνή μου ἀνέβη ὀκτώχορδα, ἐγένετο μυὸς τρύγμα, ἐγένετο ἱκετεία. "Ἐπὶ... τούτῳ;"

"Ὁ Μάγνος δύο φέρει," ἔφη ὁ Γάνδαλφος, τῇ φωνῇ πλατείᾳ ὡς σίδηρος κεκρουσμένος. "Ἐποίησε τοῦτο κατὰ τὸν Πόλεμον τοῦ Συντετριμμένου Κύκλου ὑπὸ οὐρανῷ πιπτόντων σποδῶν. Ἤνεγκέ με καὶ τὸν Σαρουμᾶνον ἑπτακαίδεκα παρασάγγας δαίμονας φεύγοντας. Ἕνα μάγον, ἕνα χόββιτον ἡμιφόβητον χειριεῖται. Ἀνάβηθι."

Προσῆλθον. Ὁ Μάγνος ὄρος ἦν, κρημνὸς λευκὸς καὶ ὄρθιος. Ὁ Γάνδαλφος πρῶτος ἀνέβη, ἡ κίνησις αὐτοῦ ῥέουσα ὡς ἔλαιον χεόμενον, ὡς ὑδράργυρος ὀλισθαίνων, ἡ μελέτη πεποιηκυῖα θέατρον. Ἐκάθισεν ἔμπροσθεν, ἡ ῥάχις εὐθεῖα ὡς κατηγορία, καὶ τὴν χεῖρα κάτω πρὸς ἐμὲ προετεινεν. Ὁ βραχίων ἐξετάθη, ὁ χιτὼν ἐρριπίζετο, τὸ ὕφασμα πτέρυξ μεγάλη, ἄχρηστος.

Ἐκράτησα καὶ ἐκαθίσθην ὄπισθεν τοῦ Γανδάλφου, τὰς περιβολὰς αὐτοῦ κατέχων.

"Μὴ πέσῃς," συνεβούλευσεν ὁ Γάνδαλφος, τῷ τόνῳ κοινολογικῷ, ὡς περὶ πράου καιροῦ διαλεγόμενος. "Ὁ Μάγνος μισεῖ τὸ ἵστασθαι."

Αἱ ὁπλαὶ τοῦ Μάγνου ἐκινοῦντο. Κλὸπ θοῦδ κλόπ. Ὁ ῥυθμὸς καθίστατο, μετρονόμος ὠμὸς καὶ σταθερός. Ἡ ὁδὸς ἀνεπτύσσετο ὑφ᾽ ἡμῖν, ὁ χοῦς γινόμενος χάλιξ, λίθοι τρίζοντες ὡς ὀστᾶ ὑπὸ τροχοῖς ἁμαξῶν αἳ λοιμικοὺς πρὸ αἰώνων ἔφερον.

Τὰ δένδρα παρήρχοντο, γινόμενα ἀμυδρώματα χλωρὰ καὶ φαιά, οἱ κλάδοι ὀνυχίζοντες τὸν ἀέρα ὃν ἤδη ἐκλελοίπαμεν.

"Λάβε τὴν λεωφόρον," ἐβόησα, ἡ φωνή μου ῥηγνυμένη ὑπ᾽ ἀνέμου, ὑπὸ τοῦ πυρίκαυστου πνεύματος τοῦ Μάγνου.

Ὁ Γάνδαλφος ἐπέστρεψε τὴν κεφαλὴν μερικῶς· ὁ πώγων ἐμαστιγοῦτο ὡς σημεῖα ἐν καταιγίδι. "Λεωφόρον;"

"Ναί. Λεωφόρον. Τὴν ἀσφαλτινὴν ταινίαν, μέλαιναν καὶ λείαν, ἔνθα νεωτερικὰ ὀχήματα τὰς πετρελαιοκινήτους προσκυνήσεις ἄγουσιν. Θᾶττον ἀφιξόμεθα. Ταχύτερον. Ἐν ἓξ ὥραις ἀντὶ δώδεκα."

Ἐσκέψατο, ἡ χεὶρ ἀνατείνασα τὸν πώγωνα ψηλαφῆσαι καθ᾽ ὃν ὁ ἄνεμος χεῖρον αὐτὸν συνέπλεκεν, ἅμματα δημιουργῶν ἃ τηκτικὰ βιομηχανικὰ ἂν ἔδει λύειν. "Ὁ Μάγνος," ἔφη πρὸς τὸν ἵππον, "δύναται τὴν λεωφορικὴν κίνησιν χειρίζεσθαι. Ἦ οὔ, Μάγνε;"

Ὁ Μάγνος ἐφύσησεν, ὁμολογία ἴσως, ἴσως δὲ μόνον τὰς ῥῖνας μυιῶν σκοπουσῶν καθαίρων.

Ἐστρέφημεν. Ἡ ὁδὸς ὑφ᾽ ἡμῖν μετέβαλλεν, ὁ χάλιξ γινόμενος ἄσφαλτος, ἡ ἐπιφάνεια λεία, λίαν λεία, λειότης ἀφύσικος δι᾽ ὀργάνων κατασκευασθεῖσα ἃ τὰ ὀστᾶ τῆς γῆς ἔθερμαινε καὶ πλατέα ἐξέτεινεν.

Ἡ ἀνάβασις πρὸ ἡμῶν ἀνέτειλεν, καμπύλη λιθίνη ἑλικοειδῶς ἀναβαίνουσα ὡς ἑστραμμένη σπείρα τοῦ βίου, ἀνιοῦσα εἰς τὸν μεταλλικὸν ποταμὸν ὁ ταχὺς καὶ θανατηφόρος ἔρρεεν. Ἡ κίνησις ἐχέετο, ὀχήματα σπεύδοντα, κομῆται χαλκοῖ μετὰ ἀνθρώπων ἐντὸς τῆς ταχύτητος εἱργμένων.

Ὁ Μάγνος τὴν λεωφόρον ἔπληξεν. Αἱ ὁπλαὶ τὴν ἄσφαλτον ἔκρουσαν, ὁ ἦχος ἠχῶν κλὸπ κλὸπ κλὸπ ἠνεγμένος ὑπὸ ἐπιφανείας οὐχ ὁπλαῖς ἀλλὰ καυτῇ ῥητίνῃ προορισθείσης.

Ὀχήματα παρήρχοντο. Φορδικὸν ὄχημα ἐξ ἀριστερᾶς, κυανοῦν ἀμυδρόν, οὖὖὖ, ὁ ἦχος αὐτοῦ συμπεπιεσμένος καὶ ἐκτεταμένος. Κέρας ἐβόησεν, συνεχὴς νότος θυμοῦ· τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ ἡνιόχου ὁρατὸν στιγμὴν μίαν, στόμα πλατύ, βοῶν, ὀφθαλμοὶ ἐξογκούμενοι ὡς ἰχθύες ἐπὶ καταστρώματα συρθέντες, εἶτα ἀπῆλθεν, καταποθεὶς ὑπὸ τῆς ἀποστάσεως.

Μέγιστον ὄχημα εἰς δεξιάν, ἀργυροῦν θηρίον μετὰ χαλκῆς προτομῆς σελαχώδους μειδιώσης, ὦυυυυ. Ὁ ἡνίοχος ἐσημήνατο, δάκτυλον ἕνα ἀνατείνας, κατηγορικὸν καὶ ἀνατομικῶς ἀδύνατον ἐν τῇ προτεινομένῃ τροχιᾷ.

Ἅμαξα πετρελαιοκίνητος παρεβρόντησεν, ὀκτωκαίδεκα τροχοὶ βροντῆς μηχανικῆς. Ἡ λαῖλαψ ἡμᾶς πλαγίως ἔπληξεν, τυφὼν ἠγριωμένος· ὁ Μάγνος ἀντεσταθμίζετο, οἱ μύες σφιγγόμενοι καὶ ἁρμοζόμενοι, αἱ ὁπλαὶ εὑρίσκουσαι στῆριγμα ἐπὶ τῆς ἐπισφαλοῦς ἀσφάλτου. Διεσώθημεν. Μόλις. Τὸ κέρας τῆς ἁμάξης, βαθύ, βαρύφωνον, ἡ φωνὴ θεοῦ πετρελαιοκινήτου ὠργισμένου, χαῖρον αἰσχρῶς ἐφθέγξατο.

Ἔμπροσθεν, οἰκοδόμημα ἐξ ἀτμοῦ καὶ ἀποστάσεως ἀνέφυ· τελωνεῖον. Οἱ θάλαμοι αὐτοῦ ἐκαθέζοντο διὰ τῶν ὁδῶν ὡς λίθινοι βάτραχοι, φραγμοὶ μηχανικοὶ μετὰ βραχιόνων ἀνατεινομένων καὶ πιπτόντων, πάλιν ἀνατεινομένων ἐν ῥυθμῷ ὑπνωτικῷ.

Προσήλθομεν. Ὁ Μάγνος ἐβράδυνεν, αἱ ὁπλαὶ αὐτοῦ ἠπιώτεραι νῦν, κτύπος κτύπος κτύπος, σχεδὸν εὐπρεπῶς, σχεδὸν ἀπολογητικῶς διὰ τὸ ὑπάρχειν ἐν χώρῳ οὐκ αὐτῷ πεποιημένῳ.

Θύρα θαλάμου ἠνοίγη. Γυνὴ ἐξῆλθεν, ἡ στολὴ στιλπνὴ καίπερ τοῦ θέρους, καίπερ τῆς ἀπιθανότητος. Τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῆς σύγχυσις ἐνσωματωμένη, ἀπιστία σάρξ γενομένη, καὶ πινάκιον ὄνομα 'Δέμβρα' φέρον ἐπὶ τοῦ στέρνου ἦν προσηλωμένον. Αἱ ὀφρύες αὐτῆς πρὸς τὴν θριχώδη γραμμὴν ἀνέβησαν· τὸ στόμα αὐτῆς ἠνοίχθη, ἐκλείσθη, πάλιν ἠνοίχθη ὡς ἰχθὺς ἐπὶ λιμενοδόκων ἀσθμαίνων.

"Οὐ δύνασθε τοῦτο τὸ ζῷον ἐπὶ τῆς λεωφόρου ἐλαύνειν!"

Ὁ Γάνδαλφος ἠνωρθώθη.

"Ἐλαύνειν;" Ἡ φωνὴ κάτω ἔπεσεν, κατέβη, ὀκτώχορδον εἰς τὸ ὑπόγειον πεσὸν ἔνθα τὸ φῶς ἀποθνῄσκει. Τὸ ῥῆμα εἶχε, διεσκόπει αὐτό, ἀνάξιον ηὗρεν, ὑπερηφανείας στάζον, καταφρονήσεως βεβρεγμένον, ὠκεάνιον τῷ μεγέθει.

Ἐπαύσατο.

"Ἱππεύειν. Ἱππεύομεν τὸν ἵππον."

Ἡ γραμματικὴ διδαχὴ παρεδόθη. Ὁ τόνος καθηγητικός, καταφρονητικός· τὸ ῥῆμα διωρθώθη· ἡ πρᾶξις ἐσαφηνίσθη· τὸ γλωσσικὸν ἁμάρτημα εὐθὺς ἐκολάσθη.

Ἡ Δέμβρα ἔψελλεν, ἐπεξεργαζομένη ὡς εἰ σφάλμα συντακτικὸν ὁρατὸν ἦν, αἱ χεῖρες νῦν ἐρριπίζοντο, χειρονομίαι ἀπελπισμέναι, γυνὴ πνιγομένη ἀέρος ἀπουσίαν κρατοῦσα.

"Ἵπποι οὐκ ἐπιτρέπονται! Οὐ ζῷα! Οὐ κτήνη!"

"Τὴν ἐπομένην ἔξοδον λαβόντες διὰ τοῦ δρυμοῦ πορευσόμεθα," ἀνεφώνησεν ὁ Γάνδαλφος.

Αἱ ὁπλαὶ τοῦ Μάγνου πάλιν ἤρξαντο, κλὸπ κλὸπ κλόπ, τῆς Δέμβρας κραυγαζούσης ὄπισθεν ἡμῶν, τῶν λόγων εἰς ἄνεμον διαλυομένων.

* 1 # Κεφάλαιον Ζ': Ὁ Σταθμὸς τῆς Ἀναδυναμώσεως

Ἡ ἀποκλίνουσα ὁδὸς ἐκάμπτετο, κατεσπειροῦτο κάτω, ὁ Μάγνος κατέβαινε προσεκτικῶς, αἱ ὁπλαὶ αὐτοῦ ὁδὸν εὑρίσκουσαι διὰ τῶν ῥαγάδων ἔνθα φιλότιμα βοτάνη διεώθει, χώραν ἀνακτωμένη ῥίζῃ μιᾷ κατὰ καιρόν. Ἀφικόμεθα εἰς τὸ κάτω, ἀφικόμεθα εἰς τὸ ἐπίπεδον τῆς ὁδοῦ, ἀφικόμεθα εἰς κατάστασιν ἄτοπον.

Ἅρματα ἦσαν πανταχοῦ, δεκάδες, εἰκοσάδες, ἴσως ἑκατοντάδες ἐσκοτισμέναι ἐν τῷ πόρρω. Νεκρὰ ἐκάθηντο, αὐτοκινητικὰ πτώματα, αἱ θύραι αὐτῶν ἠνεῳγμέναι ὡς ἰχθύων στόματα ἀσπαίροντα τελευταίας ἀναπνοάς, αἱ καλύπτραι αὐτῶν ἐξέθετον τὰς ἀποτυγχανούσας μεταλλίνας καρδίας. Ἡνίοχοι ἵσταντο, συναθροιζόμενοι· θρόμβος συγχύσεως μετὰ φόβου διαχεομένου διά.

Ἐβραδύναμεν εἰς βάδισιν, αἱ ὁπλαὶ τοῦ Μάγνου, κλὶπ κλὸπ κλίπ, εὐγενὴς κρότος, σεβομένη τὰ νεκρὰ μηχανήματα περιέχοντα. Τὸ θηρίον ᾔδει θάνατον ὅτε ὤσφραινετο, καὶ θάνατον πυριτιοειδῆ, ἠλεκτροδυνάμει κινούμενον.

Ἀναδυναμωτὴρ σταθμὸς ἐπεσκίαζε μέσον τὸ θέατρον μετὰ σκελετώδους μεταλλίνου πλαισίου, ἡλιοδέκται πίνακες διεπετάννυντο ὑπεράνω πτερυγοειδῶς, ἄχρηστοι νῦν ὡς τιτθοὶ ἐπὶ ταύρῳ. Ὑπ᾽ αὐτῷ, σταθμοὶ ἀναδυναμώσεως ἵσταντο κενοί, σύρματα κρεμάμενα ἀτονῶς ὡς νεκροὶ ὄφεις, αἱ συνδέσεις αὐτῶν στόματα ἀνεῳγμένα, πεινῶντα, ἄδυνα.

Ἀνὴρ ἐν ὀπτικοῖς ὀργάνοις, χαλκοπεριγράπτοις, καθαροῖς, ἵστατο πλησίον τῆς κιοσκείου τῆς εἰσόδου, χεῖρες σημαίνουσαι ὀξέως πρὸς τὸν συναθροιζόμενον ὄχλον. Ὁ χιτὼν αὐτοῦ ἐφόρει σῆμα κεντητόν· "Σταθμὸς Χλωροδυνάμεως."

"Ἰδού, οὐκ οἶδα τί ἐγένετο! Τὸ σύστημα, ἐσκοτίσθη. Πᾶν αὐτό. Αἱ Δυναμοθῆκαι, ἡ ἡλιακὴ τροφή, ἡ σύνδεσις τοῦ ἐφεδρικοῦ δικτύου, πάντα. Ἔχω τὴν ἑταιρείαν ἐπὶ τῆς ἀναμονῆς τεσσαράκοντα λεπτά, καὶ παίζουσι τὴν καταραμένην μουσικὴν λείαν. Ἁπλῶς κλίκ. Οἴχεται. Ὅλον μου τὸ σύστημα τῶν δυναμοθηκῶν, νεκρόν. Ἑβδομήκοντα τρία τοῖς ἑκατὸν δύναμιν εἶχον. Εἶχον. Τὸ πίναξ ἀνέλαμψε, 'Ἀποτυχία Δυναμοσυστήματος', εἶτα οὐδέν. Νεκρόν. Νεκρότερον τοῦ γάμου μου, νεκρότερον τῆς ἐλπίδος μου τοῦ ἀναπαύεσθαι πρὸ ἑβδομήκοντα ἐτῶν."

Γυνὴ παρ᾽ αὐτόν, φοροῦσα βράκας γυμναστικάς, ὀπτικὰ ὄργανα πολυτελῆ κείμενα ὑπὲρ τῆς κεφαλῆς, "Εἰμὶ..." ἐσήμανε βιαίως, χεῖρες κόπτουσαι ἀέρα, "...δύο μίλια ἀπὸ οἴκου. Δύο μίλια. Νῦν εἰμι ἐνταῦθα, ἀπειλημμένη ἐν τούτῳ τῷ θεοκαταράτῳ σταθμῷ δυναμώσεως ὃς οὐ δυναμοῖ, θεωροῦσα τὰ ὤνια μου διαφθειρόμενα ἐν τῷ κιβωτίῳ. Τὸ παγωτὸν ἐτάκη. Ὁ ὄρνις θερμαίνεται. Ἔχω σύνοδον διὰ τῆς τηλεθεωρίας ἐν τεσσαράκοντα λεπτοῖς καὶ τὸ δελτάριόν μου ἐν τῷ ἅρματι καὶ τὸ ἅρμα οὐ..."

Φωνὴ ἀπεκόπη. Χεῖρες ἐκάλυψαν τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῆς.

"Ἔδει ἀνεγνωκέναι τοὺς ὅρους," φωνὴ ἄλλη εἶπε. Νεώτερος ἀνήρ, δέλτος γραφίδος ὑπὸ βραχίονα, προὐχώρησε. "Τμῆμα ἕβδομον, ὑποτμῆμα Δ, παράγραφος δωδεκάτη. 'Ἑταιρεία διατηρεῖ δικαίωμα ἀχρηστεύειν, μεταβάλλειν, ἢ καταλύειν λειτουργίαν παντὸς συνδεδεμένου μηχανήματος, παντὶ καιρῷ, δι᾽ αἰτίαν ἣν ἑταιρεία κρίνει ἀναγκαίαν, συμπεριλαμβανομένων ἀλλ᾽ οὐ περιοριζομένων εἰς μερίμνας ἀσφαλείας, συμμόρφωσιν νομοθετικήν, ἢ στρατηγικὰς ἐμπορικὰς ἀποφάσεις. Χρήστης συμφωνεῖ παραιτεῖσθαι πάσας ἀξιώσεις. ' Πάντες ἐπατήσατε 'Συμφωνῶ. ' Συνεφωνήσατε."

"Ὦ, σιώπα, οὐδεὶς ἀναγιγνώσκει ἐκεῖνα," ἡ γυνὴ τῶν βρακῶν γυμναστικῶν εἶπεν. Ἁπλῶς. Τελικῶς.

Πρεσβύτερος ἀνὴρ ἐπρόσκλινε πρὸς κλίνην ἁμάξης φορτίου, φορῶν ἐργατικὰς ἐσθῆτας λιπαρὰς ἀρχαίας, χεῖρας τετατουϊσμένας διὰ παντὸς ἐλαίῳ κινητηρίῳ. Τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ δερματικὸν τετριμμένον, ὑπὸ ἡλίου δεδαρμένον, ὀφθαλμοὶ μεμυκότες εἰς σχισμὰς λογιζόμενοι. "Δυναμοθῆκαι," εἶπε, φωνῇ χαλικώδει τραχείᾳ, ἕκαστον ῥῆμα λίθος πεσών. "Οἱ σταθμοὶ ἡλιακῆς ἀναδυναμώσεως, πάντες αὐτῶν, ἐργάζονται ἐπὶ δυναμοθηκῶν, μοντέλου ΗΞ ἐννέα. Ἡ ἑταιρεία ἣ ἐποίησεν αὐτάς, κατέστησεν αὐτάς, καὶ ὑπέσχετο 'ἐπανάστασιν ἐνεργειακῆς αὐτονομίας' καὶ 'δυναμικὴν ἐλευθερίαν. ' Ἐλευθερίαν." Ἔπτυσεν. Ὁ φαιὸς βῶλος ἐπάταξε τὴν ἄσφαλτον, ἐσύριξεν ἡσύχως. "Τήμερον, νυκτὸς ἀρχομένης, ἑταιρεία ἔστρεψε τὸν διακόπτην. Διακόπτην θανάτου. Αἱ δυναμοθῆκαι εἶχον χημείαν πταίουσαν, αἱ λιθιακαὶ κυψέλαι αὐτῶν φθειρόμεναι θᾶττον τοῦ προβληθέντος, ἡ θερμικὴ φυγὴ αὐτῶν ἐπικειμένη. Ἐξ ἀποστάσεως ἠχρήστευσαν πᾶσαν μονάδα δυναμοθήκης, ταυτοχρόνως."

Εἷς ἀνὴρ ἐλάκτισε τὸν τροχὸν τοῦ ἅρματος αὐτοῦ. Σφοδρῶς. Ὁ πούς αὐτοῦ ἀνέπηδεν, ἄλγησις φανερὰ ἐκ τοῦ τρόπου ὃν ἐπήδα, καταρώμενος κολλυροειδῶς, ἕκαστον ῥῆμα λίθος πολυτελὴς ὑπὸ μανίας ἐστιλβωμένος.

Ἀνὴρ κατεκλίθη πρὸς ἅρμα, τηλέφωνον κρεμάμενον ἐκ τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ, φωνὴ ὑπὸ αὐτομάτου ἠχοῦσα· "Ὁ ἐκτιμώμενος χρόνος ἀναμονῆς ἐστι, τριάκοντα ἑπτὰ λεπτά. Παρακαλῶ συνεχίσατε ἀναμένοντες. Ἡ κλῆσις ὑμῶν ἐστι σπουδαία..."

"Σπουδαία;" ἐβόησε πρὸς τὸ τηλέφωνον. "Τότε ἀποκρίνασθε, βαστάρδοι ἀλγοριθμικοί."

Παρηλάσαμεν. Αἱ ὁπλαὶ τοῦ Μάγνου ηὗρον ῥυθμὸν πάλιν. Κρότος κτύπος κρότος. Σταθερῶς. Βεβαίως. Φέρων ἡμᾶς πρόσω ἀπό.

Ὀπίσω ἡμῶν, φωναὶ πλείονες ἤγειροντο, κακοφωνία ἐπιστοιβαζομένη· παράπονα, ἀπειλαί, εὐχαὶ ἴσως. Τις ἐκλαίε. Ἄλλος ἐγέλα, παιδίον ἠρώτα, "Πάτερ, πότε ἐρχόμεθα οἴκαδε;" καὶ οὐδεμίαν ἀπόκρισιν ἐλάμβανε.

* 1 # Κεφάλαιον Ὄγδοον: Ἡ Τοροειδὴς Ἀράχνη

Ἡ ὕλη κατέπιεν ἡμᾶς ὅλους· τὰ δένδρα ἵσταντο στέλεχος πρὸς στέλεχος ὡς συνωμόται. Τὸ φῶς, ὅσον ὀλίγον αὐτοῦ ἐλείπετο, ἔσταζε διὰ τῶν χασμάτων ἐν τῇ στέγῃ τῶν φύλλων ἐν ρίγαις, φωτίζον τμήματα κόνεως καὶ ῥίζης καὶ τὸν ἐνίοτε βρύῳ πωγωνισμένον λίθον.

Αἱ ὁπλαὶ τοῦ Μάγνου εὗρον μαλθακὴν βάσιν ἐπὶ αἰώνων ἀξίαις βελόναις πιτυίναις, σιγῶσαι τὴν πρόσοδον ἡμῶν εἰς σχεδὸν σιωπήν, πλὴν τῆς ἀναπνοῆς τοῦ θηρίου, ἐκείνου τοῦ φυσητήρων ῥυθμοῦ εἴσω καὶ ἔξω.

Εἶτα, σημεῖον.

Ξύλινόν τι πρᾶγμα, πεφυτευμένον σκολιῶς ἐν τῇ γῇ, γράμματα βαθέως κεκομμένα καὶ χρῶμα ἀποφλοιούμενον ἐν ταινίαις ὡς ἡλιοκαὴς δέρμα. Οἱ λόγοι ἐκήρυττον, ἐν ἀμφιβόλῳ ἐξουσίᾳ· "Ἡ ὉΔΟΣ ΤΗΣ ΤΟΡΟΕΙΔΟΥΣ ἈΡΑΧΝΗΣ, ΠΡΟΧΩΡΕΙ ΜΕΤ' ΕΥΛΑΒΕΙΑΣ Ἢ ΜῊ ΠΡΟΧΩΡΕΙ ὍΛΩΣ. ΟΥΚ ΕΣΜΕΝ Ἡ ΜΗΤΗΡ ΣΟΥ."

Ὑποκάτω τούτου, ἐν μικροτέροις γράμμασιν, μόλις ἀναγνωστέοις· "Σπουδαίως. Καταφάγεταί σε. Ἀπολωλέκαμεν ἓξ ἀγγελιοφόρους τοῦτον τὸν μῆνα."

Καὶ ἐκεῖ ἦν. Ἡ ἀράχνη.

Ἦν μεγίστη, τὸ σῶμα αὐτῆς τοσοῦτον ὀγκῶδες ὡς κολοκύνθη νικητήριος, τὰ ὀκτὼ σκέλη ἠρθρωμένα ὡς ἡ παράδοσις ἠξίου, ἕκαστον ἄρθρον ψοφοῦν ἀκουστῶς καὶ ἀπὸ ἀποστάσεως. Καθημένη ἐν τῷ κέντρῳ τοῦ τοροειδοῦς, τὰ σκέλη ἀκτινωτῶς διηπλωμένα καὶ ἐν σκοπίμῳ ἐνεργείᾳ ἐνειλιγμένα. Λεπτὸς ὡς θρὶξ ἀνθρώπου ἀλλὰ στίλβων μεταλλικῶς, χαλκοῦς τις σύρμα ἔλαμπεν ἐν ταῖς γναθοφυσίαις αὐτῆς καθὼς περιέβαλλεν αὐτὸ περὶ τὴν περίμετρον τοῦ τοροειδοῦς, ἑκάστην περιστροφὴν ἀκριβῆ.

"Ἑπτά," ἠρίθμει, ἡ φωνὴ αὐτῆς ψοφοῦσα, οἱ σύμφωνοι ὀξεῖς ὡς ψαλίδες. Τὰ σκέλη αὐτῆς ἐκινοῦντο, συγχρονισμένα, ὀρχηστικῶς καθὼς περιέβαλλε. "Ὀκτώ." Ἄλλη περιστροφή, τὸ σύρμα καταλαβὸν τὸ φῶς καὶ σχηματίζον ἑλικοειδὲς σχῆμα.

"Ἐννέα." Ἔπαυσε, ἓν σκέλος ἠρμένον.

Εἶτα, κίνησις. Ἀνέλυσεν ἑαυτήν, ἀφῆκε τὸ σύρμα, καὶ κατέβη ἀπὸ τοῦ τοροειδοῦς.

Ὁ Μάγνος ὀπίσω ἀνεχώρησεν· αἱ ὁπλαὶ αὐτοῦ ἐσύροντο, ὁ μόνος ὀφθαλμὸς αὐτοῦ κυλινδόμενος πανικοπλησίως. Ἡ χεὶρ τοῦ Γανδάλφου ἐσφίγγετο ἐπὶ τῇ βακτηρίᾳ αὐτοῦ.

Ἡ ἀράχνη ἥψατο γῆς, τὰ σκέλη διαπλούμενα εὐρέως, τὸ σῶμα ταπεινωθὲν θηρευτικῶς. Προσῆλθε μετὰ βουλευτῶν, ἀκριβῶν βημάτων, μηχανικῶν ἐν τῇ ἐκτελέσει ἀλλ᾽ εὐχαρίτων ὑποκάτω.

"Διὰ τί," ἐκόραξα, ὁ λάρυγξ μου ξηρὸς ὡς ἀρχαῖον διφθέρα, "οὐκέτι ὑφαίνεις δίκτυον;"

Ἔκλινε τὸ σῶμα αὐτῆς, σχῆμα σχεδὸν ἐρωτηματικόν. "Ὑφαντική;" Ἡ φωνὴ αὐτῆς ἔψοφει, κρουστική. "Ἡ ὑφαντικὴ παρηκμασμένη ἐστίν. Τὰ ἀράχνια ἀρχέγονά εἰσι. Κολλώδη καὶ ἀναποτελεσματικά. Κατασκευάζω ἠλεκτροτεχνικὰ νῦν. Μεταμορφωτὰς ἠλεκτρικούς. Ἐπαγωγεῖς. Ἠχοφόρους κυκλώματα. Τὸ μέλλον ἠλεκτρομαγνητικόν ἐστιν."

Φῶς αἰφνίδιον ἔτεμεν ἐκ τῆς στέγης τῶν κλάδων, λεπτὸς ἐρυθρὸς λασηρικὸς ἀκτίς, καὶ ἀστραπή· κώνωψ ἐξερράγη, μικρὰ ἔκρηξις, πτέρυγες διεσκορπίσθησαν.

Ἡ ἀράχνη ἐκινήθη ἀδυνάτως ταχέως. Ἓν σκέλος ἐξετάθη, συνέλαβε τὰ λείψανα τοῦ κώνωπος μεταερίως, καὶ ἤνεγκεν αὐτὰ πρὸς τὰς γναθοφυσίας αὐτῆς. Ἐμάσσατο, σκεπτικῶς.

"Ὑμμ," εἶπεν, ἀποδεκτικῶς, "βουτυρώδης."

Κατέπιε καὶ ἐπέστρεψε τὴν προσοχὴν αὐτῆς πρὸς ἡμᾶς.

"Ὁ λασηρικὸς ἀκτὶς ἐκεῖνος," εἶπον, δεικνὺς ἀόριστα εἰς τὴν κατεύθυνσιν αὐτοῦ, "σὺ κατεσκεύασας τοῦτο;"

"Δηλονότι," εἶπεν. Τὰ ὀκτὼ σκέλη αὐτῆς ἐμετακινοῦντο, ἀνυπομονῶς. "Στερεοειδὴς δίοδος λασηρική. Ὀπτικὰ ἰδιοσκευή. Ἀλγόριθμος κινησιοϊχνευτικός. Σύστημα στοχασμοῦ αὐτόνομον. Οἱ κώνωπες ποιοῦσιν ἐξαιρέτους πειραστάς, ὑψηλὴν ἀντίθεσιν πρὸς τὸν οὐρανόν, τὰ πτητικὰ σχήματα ἀτάκτως ἱκανὰ πρὸς τὸ προκαλεῖν τὴν βαθμονόμησιν. Πρόσθεν δέ," συνέκλεισε τὰς γναθοφυσίας μετ᾽ ἱκανοποιήσεως, "ἡδεῖς. Τὸ λάσηρον καραμελοποιεῖ αὐτοὺς ὀλίγως. Προστίθησι χυμικὴν πολυπλοκότητα."

Ὁ Γάνδαλφος ἔκλινε πρόσω ἐν τῇ σέλλᾳ αὐτοῦ. "Ἀπέλιπες τὴν ἀραχνοϋφαντικήν," ἐβρόντησεν, "ὑπὲρ τῆς κυκλωματοκατασκευαστικῆς;"

Ἐνεῦσε μετὰ σκέλους πρὸς τὸ τοροειδὲς ἔτι αἰωρούμενον καὶ περιστρεφόμενον βραδέως ἐν τῷ ὄπισθεν. "Τὰ ἀράχνια μονοσκοπά εἰσι· λαβεῖν τροφήν. Πληκτικά. Προβλεπτά. Ἀλλὰ τὰ ἠλεκτροτεχνικά, ἔχουσιν ἀπέραντα ἐφαρμογάς. Σηματοεπεξεργασίαν. Δυναμομετατροπήν. Ἀσυρμοφόρτισιν. Ἀναπτύσσω ἐπακτικοσυζευκτικὸν σύστημα πρὸς σὴς πρὸς σῆτα κοινωνίαν. Ἐπαναστατικόν."

Ἐκ τῆς στέγης τῶν κλάδων ἄλλος κώνωψ κατέβαινεν, ἡ ὁδὸς αὐτοῦ αὐτοκτονική. Ἀστραπή. Ὁ λασηρικὸς ἀκτὶς εὗρεν αὐτὸν εὐθύς. Τὸ πτῶμα ἔπλευσε κάτω· ἡ ἀράχνη ἔλαβε καὶ κατέφαγεν αὐτό.

"Μμμ," εἶπεν. "Ἐκεῖνος εἶχε χυμοὺς ἑλώδους ὕδατος καὶ Ο ἀρνητικοῦ αἵματος."

Ὁ Μάγνος ἔσκαψε τὴν γῆν, ἡ ὁπλὴ αὐτοῦ ξύουσα λίθον. Οὐκ ἐμέμφθην αὐτόν.

* 1 # Κεφάλαιον Θ': Ἡ τῆς ἀράχνης συμβουλή

Ἡ ἀράχνη ἐστράφη καὶ ἔδραμε πρὸς μηχάνημά τι, μεταξὺ δύο δένδρων κείμενον. Λογιστικὸν πινάκιον, βδέλυγμά τι ἐκ πυριτίου ἐγκεφάλου πεποιημένον, ἐπὶ βάθρου ἐξ ὑαλίνων ἰνῶν πεπλεγμένου ἐκάθητο, τῇ ὄψει αὐτοῦ κυανῷ φωτὶ νοσώδει ἐν τῷ σκότῳ τοῦ δρυμοῦ λαμπούσῃ.

Προσῆλθε πρὸς αὐτό, τοῖς πρώτοις ποσὶν ἐκτεινομένοις, τὸ πληκτρολόγιον ἁπτομένη μετὰ λεπτότητος ἀσεμνοτάτης διὰ τὸ μέγεθος αὐτῆς. Αἱ κλεῖδες ἐψόφουν, τύπτε τύπτε τύπτε τύπτε, οἱ πόδες αὐτῆς μετ᾽ ἀκριβείας γραμματέων κινούμενοι, ἑκάστη πληγὴ ἑκούσιος.

«Ἐπαγωγὴ ῥεύματος,» ἀνήγγειλε, τῇ φωνῇ διατεμνούσῃ τὸν ἀέρα ὥσπερ ψαλὶς διὰ βρεχομένου χάρτου. «Ἡ τοῦ τοροειδοῦς ἐπαγωγὴ δεῖ λογισθῆναι. Ἀκρίβεια παράπαν ἀναγκαία. Εἰκασία μόνον θηλαστικῶν πρέπει. »

Ἐπὶ τῆς ὄψεως, θυρίδες ἤνθουν, κῶδιξ καταρρέων, ἀλγόριθμοι ἀναπτυσσόμενοι ὥσπερ ἔντερα ἐξ ἐξαυλωμένου ἰχθύος. Κῶδιξ λογιστικός, ἡ σύνταξις ξένη ὡς κατάλογοι ὠνίων Ἐλφικοί. Ἀριθμοὶ ἐφάνησαν, παρήλασαν, ἠφανίσθησαν, ἄλλοθι πάλιν ἐφάνησαν.

«Ἐπετέλεσα,» εἶπεν, ἑνὶ ποδὶ πρὸς τὴν ὄψιν νεύουσα ἐνῷ ἓξ ἄλλοι ἐτύπτουν καὶ εἷς τὴν γαστέρα αὐτῆς ἔξηε, «ἀλγόριθμον τεχνητῆς φρονήσεως. Μηχανικὴν μάθησιν. Δίκτυα νευρώδη ἐπὶ θεωρίας ἠλεκτρομαγνητικῆς γεγυμνασμένα. Λογίζεται τὴν ἐπαγωγὴν χρωμένη τῷ τύπῳ...»

Ἔπαυσατο, ἡ ὄψις ἤστραψεν, ἐξέφηνεν ἐξίσωσιν:

[

\boxed{L = \frac{\mu N^{2} h}{2\pi} \ln\left(\frac{r_{\text{τελ. ἄρθρ. ἀράχν. }}}{r_{\text{σῶμ. ἀράχν. }}}\right)}

]

«Ἰδού,» εἶπεν, ἡ φωνὴ ὑπερήφανος ὡς μήτηρ τὰς πρώτας ζωγραφίας τοῦ πρωτοτόκου δεικνῦσα. «Ὁ τῆς ἐπαγωγῆς τύπος. Μεταπεποιημένος. Ὁρᾷς τὰς μεταβλητάς; Μέτρα λαμβάνω ἐκ τῆς ἐμῆς ἀνατομίας. Ἡ ἀκτὶς ἐκ τοῦ κέντρου τοῦ σώματός μου πρὸς τὸ τελευταῖον ἄρθρον. Εἰμὶ τὸ πρότυπον ἀναφορᾶς. Ἡ γεωμετρία τοῦ τοροειδοῦς τὰς ἐμὰς ἀναλογίας ἀπεικονίζει. Καλόν, οὐχί;»

Ἄλλος πούς ἔτυψε τὴν ὄψιν, τὰς μεταβλητὰς δεικνύων. «Ἡ ἀκτὶς τοῦ σώματός μου: τέσσαρα σημεῖα ἑπτὰ μέτρα. Ἡ ἀκτὶς τοῦ τελευταίου ἄρθρου: ἥμισυ μέτρον. Ὁ φυσικὸς λογάριθμος τοῦ λόγου αὐτῶν, πολλαπλασιασθεὶς ταῖς προσηκούσαις σταθεραῖς, τὴν ἐπαγωγὴν παρέχει. Ὁ ἀλγόριθμος τοῦτο ἐργάζεται, λογίζεται τὸ πάχος τοῦ σύρματος, τὴν πυκνότητα τῶν ἑλίξεων, τὴν διαπερατότητα τοῦ πυρῆνος. Καλόν ἐστιν. Μαθηματικὴ σαρκωθεῖσα. Ἤ...» ἔψηξε φρονίμως, «...σὰρξ μαθηματικωθεῖσα. »

Ὁ ἀλγόριθμος ἐκυκᾶτο, ἡ ὄψις ἀστράπτουσα μετὰ γραμμῶν προόδου καὶ τροχῶν λογισμοῦ στρεφομένων, τοῦ παγκοσμίου συμβόλου μηχανῶν φρονουσῶν, ἤ ὅτιδήποτε τὸ πυρίτιον πράττει ὅταν συνείδησιν προσποιῆται.

«Ἡ τεχνητὴ φρόνησις,» προσέθηκεν, ὀλίγον πρὸς ἡμᾶς στραφεῖσα, τοῖς πολλοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς τὸ φῶς τοῦ λογιστικοῦ πινακίου λαβοῦσι καὶ κατ᾽ ἐλάττους γαλαξίας ἀπαυγάζουσιν, «ὄργανόν ἐστιν. Ἀνάλυσις δεδομένων. Μεταλλεία δεδομένων. Τρέφω αὐτὸν ἐντροπίᾳ, κομμάτια πληροφοριῶν, συμπιεσμένα ἢ χαοτικά, κατὰ τὸ δεόμενον. Μακρὰ τεμάχη χαμηλῆς ἐντροπίας: βάσεις δεδομένων διατεταγμέναι, μετρήσεις ἠλεκτρομαγνητικῶν πεδίων, πίνακες ἀντιστάσεως σύρματος. Μικρὰ τεμάχη ὑψηλῆς ἐντροπίας: εἰσαγωγαὶ δοκιμαστικαὶ τετυχωμέναι, θόρυβος σημάτων χαοτικός, σχήματα πτήσεως κωνώπων. Ὁ ἀλγόριθμος μανθάνει. »

Ἐνεῦσεν ἑνὶ ποδὶ πρὸς τὸν περὶ ἡμᾶς δρυμόν. «Ἐνταῦθα, πᾶν δεδομένα γεννᾷ. Μεταβολαὶ θερμοκρασίας. Ταχύτης ἀνέμου. Ἠλεκτρομαγνητικὴ παρενοχλησις ἀπὸ πλησίων ἠλεκτρο-γραμμῶν, ναὶ καὶ ἐνθάδε, πολιτισμοῦ ἕλικες φθάνουσιν, ἀόρατοι ἀλλὰ μετρητοί. Ὀρύττω αὐτά. Σχήματα ἐξάγω. »

Βίγξ.

Τὸ λογιστικὸν πινάκιον ψόφον εὔθυμον προσαγγελίας ἐξέπεμψεν.

«Λογισμὸς τέλειος,» ἀνεῖπεν ἡ ἀράχνη. «Ἐπαγωγή: τριάκοντα ἑπτὰ σημεῖα τέσσαρα μιλλιοστὰ Ἑνρύ. Ἀποδεκτὴ τοῖς ἐμοῖς σκοποῖς. Τὸ τοροειδὲς λειτουργήσει ὡς κατεσκευάσθη. »

Ὁ Μάγνος ὑφ᾽ ἡμῖν ἐκινήθη, αἱ ὁπλαὶ ἀνήσυχοι, ὁ μονήρης ὀφθαλμὸς ἐν τῷ κοίλῳ αὐτοῦ στρεφόμενος ὡς σφαῖρα ἐν κεκλιμένῳ ἀγγείῳ. Τὸ θηρίον ἐγίνωσκέ τι. Τὰ ζῷα ἀεὶ γινώσκουσι πρὶν οἱ Χόμπιττοι καταλάβωσιν, οἱ ἔνστικτοι αὐτῶν θάττους τοῦ ἡμετέρου βραδέως λογισμοῦ.

Ἡ ἀράχνη ἐστράφη ὅλη πρὸς ἡμᾶς νῦν, πάσαις ὀκτὼ σκέλεσι πεφυτευμέναις, τῷ σώματι ὑποταπεινωθέντι μικρόν, στάσιν ἣν ἐγνώριζον ἐκ φυσιογνωστικῶν ὑπομνημάτων, τὸ πρὸ τοῦ πηδήματος στιγμεῖον, πρὸ ὀδόντων ἢ μανδιβύλων ἢ ὅτι δὴ ἀμυντήριον ἡ ἐξέλιξις δεδώρηται κλεισθῆναι περὶ θήραν.

«Νῦν,» εἶπεν, ἡ φωνὴ μεταβαλλομένη, μελιτώδης σχεδόν, ὁ τόνος ὃν ἔμποροι χρῶνται ὅταν μέλλωσι σε ἐξαπατᾶν, «περὶ μισθοῦ. Διὰ τὴν ἐπίδειξιν τοῦ λογισμοῦ. »

Ἄνωθεν, ἐκ τῆς κόμης ἔνθα αἱ σκιαὶ παχεῖαι ηὐξήθησαν καὶ τὸ φῶς οὐκ εἰσεδύετο, ἦλθε ψόφος. Μηχανικὸν βομβεῖον. Φακὸς ἐστοχαζόμενος.

Ὁ ἀκτινοβόλος.

Φῶς ἐρυθρὸν ὑλοποιήθη, ἀκτὶς λεπτὴ ὡς νῆμα ἀλλὰ λαμπρὰ ὡς ἀποθνῄσκων ἀστήρ, καὶ ἔτεμεν.

Οὐχ ἡμᾶς.

Τὸν Μάγνον.

Ὁ ἵππος οὐκ ἔκραξεν, οὐκ ἐδύνατο κράξαι, ὅτι ὁ ἀκτινοβόλος λίαν ταχὺς ἐκινήθη. Ἔτεμε κάθετος, χειρουργικῶς, ἀκριβῶς, ἐκ κρανίου πρὸς οὐρὰν ἑνὶ συνεχεῖ κινήματι.

Ὁ ἵππος διεχωρίσθη.

Δύο ἡμίση.

Ἀριστερὸν καὶ δεξιόν.

Ἔστησαν πρὸς στιγμήν, ἄμφω τὰ ἡμίση ὄρθια. Τὸ ἀριστερὸν ἡμίσυ εἶχε τὸν ὀφθαλμόν, τὸν μέγαν ἐκεῖνον, τῇ κόρῃ διευρυμένῃ πλατὺ ἐν ᾧ ἴσως ἦν φόβος ἢ ἔκπληξις ἢ ἁπλῶς ἡ τελευταία σύγχυσις τοῦ σώματος. Τὸ δεξιὸν ἡμισὺ εἶχε τὸ κενὸν κοῖλον, τὸ χάσμα οὗ ὀφθαλμὸς ἐχρῆν εἶναι, σκοτεινὸν καὶ κενόν.

Εἶτα ἡ βαρύτης τοῦ ἔργου αὐτῆς ἐμνήσθη.

Ἀμφότερα ἡμίση κατέρρευσαν, ἔπεσον ἀπ' ἀλλήλων, προσέκρουσαν τῇ γῇ μετὰ κτύπων οἳ ἦσαν λίαν μαλακοί, λίαν τελικοί. Ὁ Γάνδαλφος καὶ ἐγὼ κατεκυλίσθημεν, ἀποβάντες ἀκουσίως, προσκρούσαντες ταῖς πιτυΐναις βελόναις καὶ κυλινδούμενοι ἀπὸ τοῦ διχοτομημένου νεκροῦ.

Ἡ ἀράχνη προσῆλθεν. Οἱ πόδες αὐτῆς νῦν λεπτῶς ἐκινοῦντο, αἰδημόνως σχεδόν, ὡς τὰ δύο ἡμίση τοῦ Μάγνου ἐσκόπει. Ἥψατο τοῦ μετὰ τοῦ ὀφθαλμοῦ, τοῦ ἀριστεροῦ μέρους, ἑνὶ ποδί, πράως.

«Κατέξω τὸν ἵππον,» ἀνεῖπεν, ἡ φωνὴ ἐπίπεδος, ὡς περὶ τῶν φανερῶν. «Διὰ τὴν συμβουλήν. »
* Ancient greek original translation
** Chapter 1: The bridge crossing
The trees, those bent sinews of bark shuffled in my vision, roots scrabbling the soil, trunks lean inward as a gargoyle’s grin, their crooked boughs knuckling the earth in a mockery of salute. Up ahead, the Shire, that smug green pigbelly, gurgles with mirth I didn’t believe.

I, Φροδίων Baggins, the bearer of the… oh, never mind!

I lumbered through the path, into a narrow tunnel of thorns, their canes curled bristling like some ancient hedgehog’s uncombed mustache clucked it's barbed spines. Their spikes gnawed at my ankles, one splinter clutched at my coat and a button popped like a firecracker.

The mud squirms underfoot, each step birthing a new wrinkle of filth. My goat soles, once proud, now caked in mud the hue of a rancid lemon drop, dragged me down in protestations as if the very earth conspired to bill me by the step. I kick the moss sludge, and the muck now slithers and squeaks like two disgraced orators.

Dense as a wet barmaid’s apron, the fog rolls in. Not the Shire’s usual damp haze but a wet, fleshy thing that clings to my neck and it whispers in the dead tones of a drowned church organist. One tree had limped into the fog, its leaves now fluttering like a thousand fraying tongues.

A toad perched on a upturned stone birdbath, squawked with the authority of a prophet, mocking my thirst. Its throat a glistening pink balloon, voice a croak that pulsed, “Rain Rain!” I blinked. By the stars, had that bird been there two heartbeats ago? I swear not.

The path ahead splits, but both clefts lead to the same structure. Birthed from the fog, a bridge of knotted entrails, spanning a chasm where the earth yawned like a glutton’s maw. Both identical. Both snarled in rotting leaves. I chose left or right? The decision was made by my foot.

The bridge's sinewy ropes groaning as if some ancient beast had been summoned, just to die here for our benefit. Each movement squelched. The knots beneath my feet creaked, the kind of sounds echoing through motel walls at 3 AM, when the bedsprings sing their rusty hymns.

Halfway across, I stepped onto one more plank, or what passed as a plank, a single bone from an animal, which may or may not have been wise to butcher. The bone gave, it cracked and my left foot sank in up to the ankle. The abyss clutched at my calf with the enthusiasm of a grandmother who just learned her grandchild’s coming for dinner.

A moth, probably drunk on fermented nectar, collided with my forehead. I swatted it's aerial acrobatics, it's wings screaming “Ewt! Ewt!” in a voice that could only belong to a disgruntled elf.

I patted my coat. Into my pocket, fingers probing, I found a dragon’s tooth, cold, jagged, and a single button, the one that popped earlier. The tooth lodged stuck in the flap of the pocket. It had to be the one I swindled from a barkeep in Bree for a bottle of rum, no doubt.

I tried to pull it out. Stubborn thing! It resisted, caught on fabric, testing my patience. I drew it slow, slow, slow, like a sword. Finally, the tooth emerged, yellow and wicked.

The rope binding my ankle, thick as a serpent. I positioned the tooth's edge against the hemp's coarse weave, those fibers twisted together in their presumption of strength, and I sawed. Back and forth, the tooth grinding, chewing, splitting strand by strand.

At last the rope parted. The bridge sagged a bit. The abyss below stared at me with patience, knowing that gravity never forgets an appointment.

My foot yanked free, sucked from the bone gap. I stumbled forward, caught myself on the bridge's remaining ropes, those sinews still clinging to their purpose.

The rope I cut, it hung loose now, dangling like a finger wagging in disapproval.

Up ahead, the fog began to peel away in thin, shivering layers, revealing the far shore: a patch of ground flat as a sheet of parchment and ground green like a witch's sneer.

What words could better fit to a fog after all, if not for a democracy of shadows?

Behind me, the bridge snapped midair as though it had grown tired of being a bridge and, in a final act of rebellion, folded into a paper airplane and launched itself into the chasm’s gaping throat. Rocks gnashed their gums at the falling debris.

I stood on the far shore, still attached to my limbs, still fully clothed, save the missing button.

A nest of crows perched ahead, took notice of the bridge collapsing, and the whole flock erupted. Their beaks opened in unison, croaking not a death omen but an imitating, xylophonic trill of the bridge atomizing itself into a mosaic of twigs and bones.

Their wings screeched and they launched themselves into the air, hovered there a moment and dived into the yawning black trachea, which now gargled the remains with the relish of a cannibal’s stew.

The ground here, seemed to hum quiet. The fog had cleared entirely. The air was clean. The light was too bright.

** Chapter 2: Σαμύιος's house

I approached the hobbit village of Glimmerroot clung to the hillside. Houses, humps of earth they were, swollen bellies pregnant with pipe smoke, their doors circular, wood split and beetled. Windows like eyes gouged, and the spines of chimneys bent at the neck, strangled by their own smoke.

The path towards Σαμύιος's house twists in cursive, as though the ground itself is scribbling spells. Stone steps have been worn smooth by decades of hobbit feet, each a different height as if the mason had been drunk, fired, then rehired out of pity.

"Σαμύιος!" I called, my voice fracturing against the walls. No answer. His door had iron metal for a handle, rusted the color of dried blood. I gripped the handle. It burned my palm, cold as a widow's hand in a handshake of death. I pushed the door open, it shrieked its hinges.

From below, from somewhere beneath the floorboards, came a sound. “The cellar. Where the good stuff grows” I muttered to myself.

I descended the staircase, a corkscrew drilled into the earth's bowels, spiraled downward, each step narrower than the last.

Barrels lined the walls, stacked three high, their wood bloated with whatever liquids they imprisoned.

Σαμύιος was there. The floor, packed dirt, had been colonized by a colony of mushrooms, their caps fanning out in all directions, their stalks snaking across the ground, in patterns that suggested either great intelligence or great madness.

“Φροδίων! Φροδίων Baggins, you half rotted leek!” Σαμύιος’s voice boomed.

"Blimey!" he croaked, while ascending, the stairs creaking in a key that only cats could hear.

We emerged from the darkness and moved to the table, that ancient slab of wood that dominated the main room like an altar. Σαμύιος shuffled to his kitchen area, shelf upon shelf of jars, each containing liquids or solids in various stages. He selected one jar, amber liquid inside, stuff that moved when it shouldn't have moved.

“This,” Σαμύιος said, leaning forward with the intensity of a man who’d just discovered that mushrooms could be both fuel and fuel for prophecy, “is mushroom tea". His beard, bristled with sporangiophores, spitting spores like tiny parachutists into the void.

He poured. The liquid sludged from jar to cup, thick as honey, steam rose, not steam, smoke carrying with it an odor that was part earth, part death, part something else entirely, something that made my nose hairs curl in self defense.

Σαμύιος pushed the cup across the table toward me. It slid through a layer of dust, leaving a slimy trail behind it.

"It enhances lingual acuacy," I said, sipping from the cup.

"That word doesn't exist," he answered, his tea sloshing around.

“It exists, in a language I made up right now” I said, “but it may as well belong to the Thrombolic dialect, a language spoken by the fishmen of the Under Salt Sea.”


“My ring is malfunctioning lately, Σαμύιος,” I said, snatching the ring between thumb and forefinger as if it were a live coal. “For the last three days, it’s made me vanish into the wallpaper while I’m trying to eat breakfast. Think about it, toast and jam, half eaten, and poof, I’m not there. My parsnips were stranded in the air, asking questions about where their master fled.” I knocked the ring on the table. “For a year I wore the ring like a second skin. But now, it’s capricious. Yesterday, it let me be seen by a crow Σαμύιος! A bloody corvid that stole my hat!”

Σαμύιος picked up the ring, squinting at it the way a butcher examines questionable meat. Turned it over. Held it to the candlelight. The flame bent around it.

“Φροδίων,” he said, “this thing o’ yours, it's electronic, innit? Got circuits. Microthaumatology. Probably runs on tiny demons imprisoned in silicon. Those demons get lazy, the whole system crashes. Got wires and gizmos you don’t even know about?”

“Do I look like an engineer? What do I know about techno gobble whoop magic?” I snapped, slapping the ring onto the table. It rolled like a drunk beetle. “It’s not a toaster, Σαμύιος. It’s a doohickey from Μορδόρεια. You ever heard o’ Μορδόρα? They make bespoke magic for folks who want to vanish.”

He leaned in, his breath sour with mushroom tea. “Μορδόρα? As in, The Μορδόρα? Black magic manufacturing?”

“As in the only company that sells stuff to people who won’t ask questions,” I said. The advertisement promised 'Invisibility Guaranteed'." I picked up the ring, held it to the candle light. "The salesman had excellent teeth. Very convincing teeth."

"Maybe you should phone them. Maybe that gremlin of yours is just low on firmware. Ring up the company. Tell them your ring's defective, that it's making your vanishment asymmetrical."

** Chapter 3: The mordor company

The telephone, rotary beast it was, squatted on Σαμύιος's table, a black bakelite, it's cord kinked intestinal, the receiver heavy as a club meant for skulls.

Dialed. Each number a commitment, my finger jamming the rotary holes, the mechanism churning its guts, each rotation a small eternity, clickety clickety click, a mechanical digestive process, the wheel dragging back with the resistance of a reluctant executioner.

Ring. Ring. Ring.

“Welcome to Μορδόρα Customer Support, where your darkness is our business” a woman representative slithered from the other end. Smooth as arsenic in honey. “My name is Lurgathra, account number, please.”

I cleared my throat, spit caught there like a lodger refusing eviction. "Account seven seven three dash B dash nine. Φροδίων Baggins, purchaser of one invisibility ring, model Wraithmaker 3000, serial number.."

"I have your file, Mr. Baggins." Papers shuffled on her end, crisp violent sounds, like bones snapping in a efficient manner. "How may I darken your day?"

"My ring doesn't function as it should and it's gotten worse," I answered her, voice dropping to a hiss whispered. "Yesterday morning, mid-disappearance, I got stuck halfway. Top half invisible, gone, vacated the premises, bottom half plain as porridge. My legs stayed behind. They walked to the stove. They brewed tea. They were bored. My torso holidayed to the metaphysical realm, while my ankles stirred the pot!”

Silence. Then a throat clearing, professional cough.

"Mr. Baggins, let me place you on hold for one moment.."

"Wait, no.."

Music assaulted my ear canal. Not music, really. Elevator melodies composed on what sounded like a accordion made from cat intestines, violins strangled mid-note, harps weeping for mercy.

I pressed the receiver harder against my skull. Behind the music, voices. Her voice, muffled now, hand cupped over the mouthpiece some muffled voices leaked through. A chorus of Orcish wails nad her voice, distant but audible, address someone:

"Grishnákh! GRISHNÁKH! The new Orc, the one from Batch Seven, its face got stuck on the bottom of the cauldron, yes, the bottom, don't you see this one is even uglier than the rest. What do you mean 'which one?' The one that's screaming! Yes, that one. No, we can't sell it like that. I don't care if someone might want a floor faced Orc, decompose it to amino acids and start fresh. Use the big vat. The industrial vat. And for the love of the Dark Lord, stir it this time, don't just dump it in and hope." A wet, meaty splorch. "Ah yes. Young Ogg here’s having a difficulty." Metallic clattering. Another squish. "There. All better. Shhh. Good boy."

I waited. Σαμύιος watched, sipping his mushroom tea.

The music cut. Her voice returned, smooth once more.

"Thank you for holding, Mr. Baggins. I apologize for the delay. We're experiencing higher call volumes than usual, and also our manufacturing floor is experiencing what we call an 'product restructuring moment.'"

"About my ring.." I started.

"Yes. Your bisected visibility issue. I've pulled your ring's data. Model Wraithmaker 3000, purchased eighteen months ago, warranty expired.."

"Expired? I paid good coin for the extended warranty! The salesman with the excellent teeth, he promised.."

"Mr. Baggins." Her voice sharpened, knife drawn from velvet sheath. "The extended warranty covers catastrophic failure, not performance degradation. What you're experiencing is classified as 'irregular phasing,' which falls under normal wear and tear."

"Normal?" I bellowed, Σαμύιος jumping at the table's far end, his mushroom tea sloshing.

"Sir, please lower your voice. I understand your frustration. However, the execution environment logs of the ring are not available to the user. The internal workings of your ring, the diagnostic cascade, the thaumaturgic stack trace, all belong to Μορδόρα Industries. This is a security feature to prevent reverse engineering of our proprietary invisibility algorithms."

I squeezed the receiver, knuckles whitening, imagining it was her neck, no, no, not her neck, the salesman's neck, those excellent teeth chattering as I throttled him. "Security feature? I can't even see what's wrong with my own ring?"

"Correct. The logs are encrypted seventeen times, using demonic ciphers that would liquefy your brain if you attempted to read them. This is for your protection, Mr. Baggins."

"My protection." I laughed, sound scraping up my throat like gravel through a drainpipe. "I'm half invisible on a Tuesday morning, startling the milkman into cardiac arrest, and you're protecting me?"

"Sir, I can schedule a diagnostic appointment. Our next available slot is.." papers shuffling again, that bone snap sound, "..six weeks from now, Tuesday afternoon, between the hours of two and six. Someone will arrive to examine your ring. There is a service fee of forty gold pieces, non refundable, payable in advance."

"Six weeks? Forty gold pieces?"

"Alternatively," she continued, voice smooth as a confession extracted under duress, "you could purchase our new model, the Wraithmaker 4000. It features improved phasing stability, reduced spectral bleed through, and a complimentary curse removal for the first month."

"You want me to BUY ANOTHER RING?"

"The Wraithmaker 3000 is a legacy product, Mr. Baggins. We no longer manufacture replacement parts. At a certain point, upgrading becomes more cost effective than repair."

** Chapter 4: Σαύριος Μορδόρα's CEO

"Forward me," I growled into the receiver. "To your supervisor. Now. This instant."

Silence, pregnant with the weight of a thousand bureaucratic sins.

"Mr. Baggins.."

"Forward. Me."

A sigh leaked through the phone line, wind escaping a corpse's last deflation. "One moment please."

"This is Σαύριος. CEO, Μορδόρα Industries."

"Σαύριος. The Σαύριος? Eye of flame, forger of.."

"Yes yes yes, all very cinematic, my branding team outdid themselves that fiscal quarter, bonuses for everyone, champagne fountains et cetera et cetera." His voice rolled like boulders down a mountain. "Now. Your ring. The Wraithmaker 3000. Serial number etched in the fires of Mount Doom, cooled in the blood of betrayed smiths. What's malfunctioning?"

"Yesterday my legs brewed tea while my torso explored the astral plane. The day before, I sneezed and my head vanished but my body stayed, walking into walls like a decapitated chicken, crashing into furniture, terrifying the neighbors." I stammered.

"Mmm." A rumble, volcanic, continental shelf deciding whether to split. "Classic firmware decay. The demons powering your ring's core processor, tiny bastards they are, have been slacking. Happens. Your case is not unique. We have clients who vanish in threes. Clients who wake up upside down, or inside out, or just flat like pancakes. Unfortunate but inevitable."

"Inevitable?" I shrieked, Σαμύιος's teacup rattling against saucer, mushrooms on the cellar floor below probably cowering. "Inevitable? I paid good gold for this ring! The salesman, those teeth of his, he promised.."

"Salesmen promise many things, Mr. Baggins." Σαύριος's voice oozed through the phone line, honey laced with ground glass. "They promise eternity. They promise perfection. They promise, buy once, have magic forever, which, let's be honest, in your case was probably the primary selling point, wasn't it?"

"But I'm asking: How am I supposed to fix it, if I can't see how it works, if I can't diagnose my own jewelry." I bellowed, receiver pressed so hard against my skull I'd probably have circular bruise tomorrow. "If the guts of this thing belong to Μορδόρα industries, then who owns it? Me? Or you?"

Σαύριος's laugh erupted, not mirth but conquest, a sound reminding me of armies marching through burning villages, of ravens feasting on battlefield corpses, of victory flags planted in the skulls of the defeated. "Do you own it, Φροδίων Baggins? Or do you merely possess it?"

"That's, that's the same thing!"

"You purchased the ring, yes?" Σαύριος wheezed, "You misunderstand the nature of ownership in the modern age. You purchased the ring, yes? Gold exchanged hands, contract signed, perhaps in blood, perhaps in ink, the accountants don't specify. You own the physical object, the metal band warping the dimensional stability of your trousers. That's yours."

"Licensed," I repeated.

"But!" The word detonated through the phone line, shrapnel of syllables, Σαμύιος ducked like incoming artillery. "The software. The invisibility protocols. The demonic architecture that powers your vanishment—that, Mr. Baggins, you have licensed. Indefinitely, yes, for the duration of your natural life and slightly beyond, but licensed nonetheless. You own the ring. We own the magic inside it."

"And these logs, the diagnostic cascade, the thaumaturgic stack trace? You, Φροδίων Baggins, hobbit civilian, wants to peer into the guts of proprietary technology millennia developed? Technology that cost billions in research, in sacrifice literal, in blood spilled measured by the ocean?"

"The ring remains yours, Mr. Baggins. The invisibility, however, that we merely lend. Indefinitely, yes, perpetually even, but lend. You have a license. Irrevocable, non transferable, binding until death and then some. Should you violate the terms of service, reverse engineer the spells, share the incantations, attempt to jailbreak the curse, we reserve the right to remotely deactivate your licensed features. You'd be left with a very expensive, very useless circle of metal."

"Is that legal?"

"Perfectly legal," Σαύριος purred, cat satisfied after canary consumption. "Clause seventeen, subsection B, paragraph nine. 'User acknowledges that invisibility functionality constitutes licensed intellectual property and remains property sole of Μορδόρα Industries in perpetuity plus seventy years, whichever comes last.' You signed this, Mr. Baggins. Your signature sits in our vault, preserved in amber, guarded by Balrogs."

"Should you violate the terms of service, reverse engineer the spells, share the incantations, attempt to jailbreak the curse, post the source code on public forums for other malcontents, we reserve the right, Mr. Baggins, to remotely deactivate your licensed features."

"You can turn it off?"

"With a thought. With a memo. With a checkbox on a form processed by our Legal Department, Third Floor, West Wing, Carol handles those, lovely woman, makes excellent scones for the office parties. One checkbox, Mr. Baggins, and your ring becomes jewelry. Fashionable, perhaps. Shiny, certainly. Functional?" He paused, letting the word hang like a noose. "No."

"Do we have an understanding, Mr. Baggins?"

I nodded, realized he couldn't see, croaked, "Yes."

"Wonderful. Thank you for choosing Μορδόρα Industries, where your darkness is our business. Have a day."

Click.

The line went dead.

"Φροδίων," Σαμύιος said softly, "I think you need more mushroom tea."

I nodded. Words had abandoned me. Logic had fled screaming.

In a tower of black stone and spreadsheets, Σαύριος returned to his paperwork, another soul bound not by curses but by contracts, far more permanent, far more cruel.

The receiver sat heavy in my hand. Through the window, a crow landed, cocked its head, judging me with eyes that'd seen this conversation play out a thousand times before, in a thousand different houses, with a thousand different suckers clutching telephones and realizing too late they'd been sold snake oil by a man with beautiful teeth. So beautiful teeth!

** Chapter 5: Γάνδαλφος and his horse

The window, grimy thing it was, showed me movement, motion and the crackle of hooves on gravel announced a figure approaching.

A horse, white, one eyed, came trotting up the path like death's wedding carriage, all bone muscle coordination, it's hooves percussing against stone, clop thud clop, rhythm irregular, the beast favoring its left foreleg. One eye it had, the left socket empty, collapsed inward, a crater. The remaining eye rolled, massive as a boiled egg, surveying the world.

Γάνδαλφος sat astride it, his beard cascading, the waterfall of his hair gone feral and white as dishwater, his robes flapping.

"Σαμύιος," I hissed, "Γάνδαλφος's outside."

"Γάνδαλφος?" Σαμύιος's head whipped around, his tea sloshing. "The wizard Γάνδαλφος? Here? Now?"

We stumbled outside, the horse stopped. It breathed heavy, it's nostrils flaring, his breath steamed in the air, that shouldn't be cold but was anyway.

He dismounted, the horse snorted, that single eye rolling.

"What seems to be the problem, Φροδίων?" Γάνδαλφος approached.

"My ring," I started. "Bought it from Bilbo's Nephew's Shop, next to the elven hair combs section, you know the place? They sell invisibility rings, legitimate ones.."

"Legitimate," Γάνδαλφος snorted, the sound like a horse's snort, contemptuous, ancient.

"..with warning labels! Professional warning labels! 'Use this ring only if you don't respect time, space.'"

"And?" Γάνδαλφος leaned on his staff, weight shifting, waiting.

"And it's malfunctioning! Yesterday my legs walked separate from my torso. This morning? This morning, Γάνδαλφος, I blinked and my left arm vanished for six minutes. Six! Do you know how difficult it is to butter toast one armed when the missing arm is the dominant one?"

Γάνδαλφος's beard twitched, might've been smile, might've been disgust. "You phoned the manufacturer."

Not question. Statement. He knew.

"Μορδόρα Industries. Spoke with Σαύριος himself. He informed me.." I spat the words, venom laced, fury soaked, "..that I own the ring but license the invisibility. That the magic inside belongs to them. Forever. Perpetually. That they can deactivate it remotely if I violate terms of service I didn't read because who reads terms of service?"

"Everyone should," Γάνδαλφος muttered, "but no one does. Tale old as time, that one."

Σαμύιος piped up, voice mouse squeaking, "He's beside himself, Γάνδαλφος. Proper unraveled. Been drinking my mushroom tea and spiraling about ownership versus possession and.."

"How about you Γάνδαλφος?" I asked, "Why ride this cyclopean abomination instead of driving something sensible?"

The horse snorted again, offended possibly, that single eye narrowing.

"Update," Γάνδαλφος growled, word bitten off sharp. "Software update. Automatic software update installed itself during the night while my vehicle sat charging. Midnight. No warning. No consent. Just ping, 'Update available, installing now, do not disconnect power, this will take fifteen minutes.'"

"Fifteen minutes?" Σαμύιος asked.

"Seventeen hours," Γάνδαλφος roared, staff striking ground, sparks flying, actual sparks, little fires dying quick. "Seventeen hours of 'Optimizing system performance, please wait.' Morning came. Sun rose, birds sang their stupid songs. Car still optimizing. Still waiting. Checked the forums.."

"Forums?" I blinked.

"Wizard forums. Tech support for the magically inclined. Apparently this update, version 7.4.2, bricks vehicles manufactured before the Year of the Twisted Moon. Bricks them. Immobilizes them completely. Won't start. Won't charge. Just sits there, driveway decoration'."

"So you're riding.." I gestured toward the horse.

"Magnus," Γάνδαλφος said. "His name is Magnus. One eyed white stallion. I needed transportation, he needed purpose."

Magnus stamped hoof, singular eye fixing on me, it's pupil dilating, contracting, unsettling in hypnotic rhythm.

"How long until your car's fixed?" Σαμύιος ventured.

"Tech support says patch coming next week. Maybe. Possibly. 'Soon.' You know how these things go. Meanwhile, I ride Magnus. We bond. He tolerates me. Now. About your ring. Let me see it."

I pulled the ring from pocket, held it out, metal catching light wrong, bending it, distorting it, reality rippling around the circumference.

Γάνδαλφος took it, held it close, eye squinting, other eye squinting differently, examining, probing, muttering words I didn't recognize, probably shouldn't recognize.

"Mmm," he finally said. "Yes. Definitely cheap. Definitely cursed. Definitely violating approximately seven hundred regulations regarding dimensional manipulation. You're lucky you haven't phased through the planet core yet."

"Can you fix it?"

He tossed the ring back. I caught it, fumbled, nearly dropped it.

"No, Φροδίων. I cannot fix it. No one can fix it without the execution trace, because fixing costs only the replacement parts and selling you new model makes more money. Simple economics. Old as dragons hoarding gold. Older."

Magnus whinnied, agreement possibly, or hunger. Hard to tell with one eyed horses.

Σαμύιος muttered something about “not this again” and retreated into the cellar.

** Chapter 6: Riding to Μορδόρα

“Μορδόρα,” Γάνδαλφος announced, his staff planted vertical like a flag claimed in conquered soil. The word hung there, fat and final. “We go to their headquarters. The glass tower, downtown district, thirty seventh floor.”

“You’re joking,” I said, but his beard had gone rigid, its bristles electric with purpose. Γάνδαλφος never jokes, not about corporations, not about towers that scrape the clouds and house departments named “Customer Service.”

“Confronting them face to face,” he growled, his staff planted, each syllable a stone dropped in still water. “Eyeball to eyeball. You want diagnostic data? You want execution traces? You want them to open their proprietary vault and spill secrets? Phone calls get you nowhere. Emails vanish into spam folders guarded by Nazguls. But presence, breathing their recycled air, standing in their lobby with its potted ferns dying slow deaths under fluorescent lights, that makes them uncomfortable.”

Magnus stamped, his hoof striking the earth his single eye, massive as a hard boiled egg left too long in brine, swiveled and fixed on me. The assessment was brutal. The calculation was merciless.

“Both of us?” I asked. My voice climbed octaves, became a mouse squeak, became a plea. “On... that?”

“Magnus carries two,” Γάνδαλφος said, his voice flat as hammered iron. “He did it during the War of the Shattered Circle beneath a sky of falling ashes. He carried me and Saruman seventeen leagues while we dodged demons. He’ll manage one wizard, one half panicked hobbit. Get on.”

I approached. Magnus was a mountain, a cliff face white and vertical. Γάνδαλφος mounted first, his movement fluid like oil poured, like mercury sliding, practice having made it theater. He settled forward, his spine straight as accusation, and he offered his hand down to me. His arm extended, his sleeve flapping, the fabric a great, useless wing.

I grabbed and settled behind Γάνδαλφος, gripping his robes.

“Don’t fall off,” Γάνδαλφος advised, his tone conversational, as if he were discussing mild weather. “Magnus dislikes stopping.”

Magnus’s hooves moved. Clop thud clop. The rhythm established itself, a metronome cruel and steady. The path unfolded beneath us, the dirt becoming gravel, stones crunching like bones under the wheels of carts that had carried plague victims centuries ago.

The trees passed by, becoming blurs of green and brown, their branches clawing at the air we’d already vacated.

“Take the highway,” I shouted, my voice shredded by wind, by Magnus’s furnace hot breathing.

Γάνδαλφος turned his head partially; his beard whipped like flags in a storm. “Highway?”

“Yes. Highway. The asphalt ribbon, black and smooth, where modern vehicles conduct their petroleum powered pilgrimages. We’ll get there quicker. Faster. In six hours instead of twelve.”

He considered it, his hand rising to stroke his beard as the wind tangled it worse, creating knots that would require industrial solvents to unpick. “Magnus,” he addressed the horse, “can handle the highway traffic. Can’t you, Magnus?”

Magnus snorted, agreement perhaps, perhaps just clearing his nostrils of flies that had been investigating.

We turned. The path shifted beneath us, gravel transitioning to asphalt, the surface smooth, too smooth, an unnatural smoothness achieved through machines that heated the earth’s bones and spread them flat.

The on ramp rose before us, a concrete curve spiraling upward like a twisted DNA strand, ascending into the metal river that flowed fast and deadly. The traffic streamed, vehicles hurtling, metal comets with humans trapped inside their velocity.

Magnus hit the highway. His hooves struck the asphalt, the sound echoing clop clop clop amplified by a surface not meant for hooves but for vulcanized rubber.

Cars streamed past. A Ford to the left, a blue blur, whoooosh, its sound compressed and stretched. A horn blared, the sustained note of fury; the driver’s face was visible one instant, mouth wide, screaming, eyes bulging like fish dragged onto decks, then gone, swallowed by the distance.

An SUV to the right, a silver beast with a chrome grille grinning shark like, whoooosh. The driver gestured, raising a single finger, accusatory and anatomically improbable in its suggested trajectory.

A truck roared past, eighteen wheels of mechanical thunder. The gust slammed us sideways, a contained hurricane; Magnus compensated, his muscles flexing and adjusting, his hooves finding purchase on the treacherous asphalt. We survived. Barely. The truck’s horn, deep, basso profundo, the voice of an angry diesel god, blasted an obscene farewell.

Ahead, a structure emerged from heat shimmer and distance: a toll plaza. It's booths squatted across lanes like concrete toads, barriers mechanical with arms rising and falling, rising again in a hypnotic rhythm.

We approached it. Magnus slowed, his hooves gentler now, clop clop clop, almost polite, almost apologetic for existing in a space not designed for his kind.

A booth door opened. A woman emerged, her uniform crisp despite the heat, despite the improbability. Her face was confusion incarnate, disbelief given flesh, and a nametag that read 'Δέμβρα' was pinned to her chest. Her eyebrows rose toward her hairline; her mouth opened, closed, opened again like a fish gasping on dock boards.

“You cannot drive this animal on the highway!”

Γάνδαλφος straightened.

“Drive?” His voice dropped, plummeted, an octave falling into the basement where light goes to die. He held the word, examined it, found it wanting, dripping with disdain, soaked in contempt, oceanic in scale.

He paused.

“Ride. We ride the horse.”

The grammar lesson was delivered. His tone was professorial, condescending; the verb was corrected; the action clarified; the linguistic crime was punished immediately.

Δέμβρα blinked, processing as if a syntax error were visible, her hands flailed now, gestures desperate, a drowning woman clutching at the absence of air.

“Horses aren’t allowed! No animals! No livestock!”

“We'll take the next exit and go through the forest,” Γάνδαλφος announced.

Magnus hooves resumed, clop clop clop, with Δέμβρα shouting behind us, her words dissolving into wind.

** Chapter 7: The recharging station

The off-ramp curved, spiraled downwards, Magnus descended carefully, his hooves picking a path through cracks where ambitious weeds pushed through, reclaiming territory one root at a time. We reached to the bottom, we reached street level, we reached a situation that was bizarre.

Cars were everywhere, dozens, scores, maybe hundreds obscured in the distance. Dead they sat, automotive corpses, their doors hung open like fish mouths gasping final breaths, their hoods exposed their failing metal hearts. Drivers stood, congregating; a cluster of confusion with panic percolating through.

We slowed to a walk, Magnus's hooves, clip, clop, clip, polite percussion, respectful of the dead machinery surrounding. The beast knew death when he smelled it, even death silicon based, battery powered.

A recharging station loomed center stage with a skeletal metal frame, solar panels spread overhead wing like, useless now as tits on a bull. Beneath it, charging stalls stood empty, cables dangling limp as dead snakes, their connectors mouths open, hungry, unpowered.

A man in glasses, wire rimmed, pristine, stood near the entrance kiosk, hands gesturing sharp at the gathering crowd. His polo shirt bore an embroidered logo: "GreenCharge Station."

"Look, I don't know what happened! The system just, it went dark. All of it. The Powerwalls, the solar feed, the backup grid connection, everything. I've got corporate on hold for forty minutes and they keep playing that goddamn smooth jazz. Just click. Gone. My whole Powerwall garage system, dead. Seventy three percent charge I had. Had. Dashboard lit up, 'Power System Failure', then nothing. Dead. Deader than my marriage, deader than my hope of retiring before seventy."

A woman beside him, wearing yoga pants, sunglasses expensive perched atop her head, "I am.." she gestured violent, hands chopping air, "..two miles from home. Two miles. Now I'm here, stranded at this godforsaken charging station that won't charge, watching my groceries spoil in the trunk. Ice cream's melted. Chicken's warming. I've got a Zoom call in forty minutes and my laptop's in the car and the car won't.."

Voice cut off. Hands covered her face.

"Should've read the terms," another voice said. A younger man, tablet tucked under his arm, stepped forward. "Section seven, subsection D, paragraph twelve. 'Company reserves right to disable, modify, or terminate functionality of any connected device, at any time, for any reason company deems necessary, including but not limited to safety concerns, regulatory compliance, or strategic business decisions. User agrees to waive all claims.' You all clicked 'I Agree.' You agreed."

"Oh, shut up, nobody reads those," the yoga pants woman said. Simple. Final.

An older man leaned against a truck bed, coveralls wearing grease ancient, hands tattooed permanent with motor oil. His face leather worn, sun beaten, eyes squinted to slits calculating. "Powerwalls," he said, voice gravel rough, each word a stone dropped. "The solar recharging stations, all of them, run on Powerwall batteries, model HX Nine. The company that made them, installed them, and promised 'revolutionize energy independence' and 'power freedom.' Freedom." He spat. The brown glob hit the asphalt, it sizzled quiet. "This morning, zero dark thirty, company flipped the switch. Kill switch. The batteries had faulty chemistry, their lithium cells degrading faster than projected, their thermal runaway imminent. Remotely deactivated every single Powerwall unit, simultaneously."

One man kicked his car's tire. Hard. His foot rebounded, pain obvious from the way he hopped, cursing string of pearls style, each word a gem polished by fury.

A man slumped against a car, phone dangling from his hand, voice robot recorded emanating: "Your estimated wait time is, thirty seven minutes. Please continue holding. Your call is important.."

"Important?" he screamed at the phone. "Then answer, you algorithmic bastards."

We rode past. Magnus's hooves found rhythm again. Clop thud clop. Steady. Certain. Carrying us forward away.

Behind us, more voices rose, layered cacophony style: complaints, threats, prayers maybe. Someone sobbed. Someone else laughed, a child asked, "Daddy, when are we going home?" and received no answer.

** Chapter 8: The Toroidal Spider

The forest swallowed us whole; the trees stood trunk to trunk like conspirators. Light, what little remained of it, dripped through gaps in the canopy in stripes, illuminating patches of dirt and root and the occasional moss bearded stone.

Magnus’s hooves found soft purchase on centuries’ worth of pine needles, muffling our approach into near silence, save for the beast’s breathing, that bellows rhythm in and out.

Then, a sign.

A wooden thing, planted crooked in the earth, letters carved deep and paint peeling in strips like sunburned skin. The words proclaimed, with dubious authority: “THE PATH OF TOROIDAL SPIDER, PROCEED WITH CAUTION OR DON’T PROCEED AT ALL. WE’RE NOT YOUR MOTHER.”

Below that, in smaller script, barely legible: "Seriously. She'll eat you. We've lost six couriers this month."

And there she was. The spider.

She was giant, her body as bulbous as a prize winning pumpkin, her eight legs articulated as tradition demanded, each joint clicking audible even from a distance. Perched in the toroid’s center, legs spread radial and engaged in purposeful activity. Thin as human hair but gleaming metallic, a copper wire gleamed in her mandibles as she wrapped it around the toroid’s circumference, each rotation precise.

“Seven,” she counted, her voice clicking, consonants sharp as scissors. Her legs moved, synchronized, balletic as she wrapped. “Eight.” Another rotation, the wire catching the light and forming a helical pattern.

“Nine.” She paused, one leg raised.

Then, motion. She uncoiled, released the wire, and descended from the toroid.

Magnus backed up; his hooves shuffled, his solitary eye rolling panic adjacent. Γάνδαλφος’s hand tightened on his staff.

The spider touched ground, legs splaying wide, body lowered predatory. She approached with deliberate, precise steps, mechanical in execution but graceful underneath.

“Why,” I croaked, my throat dry as ancient parchment, “aren’t you knitting a web anymore?”

She tilted her body, an almost quizzical gesture. “Knitting?” Her voice clicked, percussive. “Knitting is obsolete. Webs are primitive. Sticky and inefficient. I construct electronics now. Transformers. Inductors. Resonant circuits. The future is electromagnetic.”

A sudden light cut from the canopy, a thin red laser, and zap: a mosquito exploded, a tiny detonation, wings scattered.

The spider moved impossibly fast. One leg extended, caught the mosquito remains midair, and brought them to her mandibles. She chewed, thoughtful.

“Hmm,” she said, appreciative, “buttery.”

She swallowed and turned her attention back to us.

“That laser,” I said, pointing vaguely in its direction, “you built that?”

“Obviously,” she said. Her eight legs shifted, impatient. “Solid state diode laser. Custom optics. Motion tracking algorithm. Autonomous targeting system. Mosquitos make excellent beta testers, high contrast against the sky, flight patterns erratic enough to challenge calibration. Plus,” she clicked her mandibles together with satisfaction, “delicious. The laser caramelizes them slightly. Adds flavor complexity.”

Γάνδαλφος leaned forward in his saddle. “You abandoned web spinning,” he rumbled, “for circuit construction?”

She gestured with a leg toward the toroid still suspended and rotating slowly in the background. “Webs are single purpose: catch food. Boring. Predictable. But electronics, have endless applications. Signal processing. Power conversion. Wireless charging. I’m developing an inductive coupling system for moth to moth communication. Revolutionary.”

From the canopy another mosquito descended, its path suicidal. Zap. The laser found it instantly. The corpse drifted down; the spider caught and consumed it.

“Mmm,” she said. “That one had notes of swamp water and O negative blood.”

Magnus pawed at the ground, his hoof scraping stone. I didn’t blame him.

** Chapter 9: The spider's advice

The spider pivoted and scuttled toward a contraption, wedged between two trees. A laptop, some silicon brained abomination, sat perched on a platform of woven optical fiber, its screen glowing cancer blue in the forest's murk.

She approached it, her foremost legs extending, touching the keyboard with a delicacy that seemed obscene given her bulk. The keys clicked, tap tap tap tap, her legs moving with typing pool precision, each stroke deliberate.

"Inductance," she announced, voice cutting through the air like scissors through wet newspaper. "The toroid's inductance must be calculated. Precision is paramount. Guesswork is for mammals."

On screen, windows bloomed, code cascading, algorithms unfurling like intestines from a gutted fish. Computer code, the syntax foreign as Elvish grocery lists. Numbers appeared, scrolled, vanished, reappeared elsewhere.

"I've implemented," she said, one leg gesturing at the screen while six others continued typing and one scratched at her abdomen, "an AI algorithm. Machine learning. Neural networks trained on electromagnetic theory. It calculates inductance using the formula.."

She paused, the screen flashed, displayed an equation:

[
\boxed{,L ;=; \frac{\mu,N^{2},h}{2\pi},\ln!\left(\frac{r_{\text{r_spider_last_knuckle}}}{r_{\text{r_spider_body}}}\right),}
]

"There," she said, voice proud as a mother showing off her firstborn's finger paintings. "The inductance formula. Modified. See those variables? I take measurements from my own anatomy. The radius from my body's center to my last knuckle joint. I am the reference standard. The toroid's geometry mirrors my own proportions. Elegant, no?"

Another leg tapped the screen, indicating the variables. "My body radius: four point seven meters. Last knuckle radius: half a meter. The natural logarithm of their ratio, multiplied by the appropriate constants, yields inductance. The AI processes this, accounts for wire gauge, turn density, core permeability. It's beautiful. Mathematics made flesh. Or.." she clicked thoughtfully, "..flesh made mathematics."

The algorithm churned, the screen flickering with progress bars and rotating calculation wheels, that universal symbol of machines thinking, or whatever silicon does when it's pretending to be conscious.

"AI," she continued, turning slightly toward us, her multiple eyes catching the laptop's glow and reflecting it back in miniature galaxies, "is a tool. Data analysis. Data mining. I feed it entropy, chunks of information, compressed or chaotic, depending on what's required. Long chunks of low entropy data: structured databases, electromagnetic field measurements, wire resistance tables. Small chunks of high entropy data: randomized test inputs, chaotic signal noise, mosquito flight patterns. The algorithm learns."

She gestured with one leg toward the forest around us. "Out here, everything generates data. Temperature fluctuations. Wind velocity. Electromagnetic interference from nearby power lines, yes even here, civilization's tendrils reach, invisible but measurable. I mine it. Extract patterns.

Bing.

The laptop emitted a cheerful notification sound.

"Calculation complete," the spider announced. "Inductance: thirty seven point four millihenries. Acceptable for my purposes. The toroid will function as designed."

Magnus shifted beneath us, his hooves restless, that single eye rolling in its socket like a marble in a tilted jar. The beast knew something. Animals always know before hobbits catch up, their instincts faster than our plodding reason.

The spider turned fully toward us now, all eight legs planted, body lowered slightly, a stance I recognized from nature documentaries, the moment before the pounce, before teeth or mandibles or whatever weaponry evolution had gifted closed around prey.

"Now," she said, voice shifting, honeyed almost, the tone salesmen use when they're about to shaft you, "about payment. For the calculation demonstration."

From above, from the canopy where shadows grew thick and light refused to penetrate, came a sound. A mechanical whirr. A focusing lens adjusting.

The laser.

Red light materialized, a beam thin as thread but bright as a dying star, and it cut.

Not us.

Magnus.

The horse didn't scream, couldn't scream, because the laser moved too fast. It sliced vertical, surgical, precise, from skull to tail in one continuous motion.

The horse separated.

Two halves.

Left and right.

They stood for a moment, both halves upright. The left half had the eye, that massive, pupil dilated wide in what might have been horror or surprise or simply the body's last confusion. The right half had the empty socket, the crater where an eye should have been, dark and vacant.

Then gravity remembered its job.

Both halves collapsed, fell away from each other, hit the ground with thuds that were too soft, too final. Γάνδαλφος and I tumbled, dismounting involuntarily, hitting the pine needles and rolling away from the bisected corpse.

The spider approached. Her legs moved delicate now, respectful almost, as she examined the two halves of Magnus. She touched the one with the eye, the left side, with one leg, gentle.

"I will keep the horse," she announced, her voice flat, matter of fact. "For the advice."

Ἐβάδιζον βαρέως διὰ τῆς ὁδοῦ, εἰς στενὸν ὄρυγμα ἀκανθῶν, ὧν αἱ κάλαμοι ἐστρέφοντο χαῖται ὡς ἀρχαίου ἐχίνου ἀχτένιστος μύσταξ τὰς βελόνας ἐκάκκαζεν. Αἱ ἄκανθαι τοὺς ἀστραγάλους μου ἔτρωγον, μία σχίδαξ τὸν χιτῶνά μου ἐλάβετο καὶ κόμβος ἀνέπηδε ὡς πυρσός.

Ὁ πηλὸς σπαίρει ὑπὸ πόδα, ἑκάστη βάσις νέαν ῥυτίδα ῥύπου τίκτουσα. Αἱ αἰγείοι πέδιλαί μου, πρὶν μὲν ὑπερήφανοι, νῦν δὲ πηλῷ κεχρισμέναι τῷ χρώματι σηπεδόνος λιμνησίου ποώδους, κατέσπων με ἐν διαμαρτυρίαις ὡς ἡ γῆ αὐτὴ συνεμάχετο τιμὴν πράττεσθαι κατὰ βῆμα. Λακτίζω τὸν βρύον ἰλύν, καὶ ὁ βόρβορος νῦν ὀλισθαίνει καὶ τρίζει ὡς δύο ἠτιμασμένοι ῥήτορες.

Παχὺ ὡς ὑγρὸν ἐπένδυμα καπήλισσαν, τὸ νέφος εἰσέρχεται. Οὐχ ἡ συνήθης τῆς Σειρίδος ὑγρὰ ἀχλύς, ἀλλ᾽ ὑγρόν τι σαρκῶδες ὃ προσκολλᾶται τῷ αὐχένι μου καὶ ψιθυρίζει τοῖς νεκροῖς τόνοις ὀργανιστοῦ ναοῦ βεβυθισμένου. Ἓν δένδρον εἰς τὸ νέφος ἐχώλαινε, τὰ φύλλα νῦν πτερυγίζοντα ὡς χίλιαι λωβώμεναι γλῶσσαι.

Βάτραχος ἐφ᾽ ὑπτίου λίθου λουτρῶνος ἐκάθητο, ἐκοάξε μετὰ τῆς ἐξουσίας προφήτου, τὴν δίψαν μου χλευάζων. Ὁ λαιμὸς αὐτοῦ στίλβων ῥοδοειδὴς φυσαλλίς, ἡ φωνὴ κρωγμὸς ὃς ἐπάλλετο, "Ὄμβρος! Ὄμβρος!" Ἔβλεψα. Πρὸς τῶν ἄστρων, ἆρ᾽ ἐκεῖνος ὁ ὄρνις ἐκεῖ ἦν δύο σφυγμοὺς πρότερον; Ὀμνύω οὔ.

Ἡ ὁδὸς πρόσω διασχίζεται, ἀλλ᾽ ἀμφότεραι αἱ σχισμαὶ πρὸς τὸ αὐτὸ δημιούργημα φέρουσιν. Ἐκ τοῦ νέφους γεννηθεῖσα, γέφυρα πεπλεγμένων ἐντέρων, χάσμα διατείνουσα ἔνθα ἡ γῆ ἐχήνει ὡς λαίμαργος στόμα. Ἀμφότεραι ὅμοιαι. Ἀμφότεραι ἐμπεπλεγμέναι σηπομένοις φύλλοις. Ἀριστερὰν ἢ δεξιὰν εἱλόμην; Ὁ πούς μου τὴν κρίσιν ἐποίησεν.

Αἱ νευρώδεις σχοῖνοι τῆς γεφύρας ἐστέναζον ὡς ἀρχαῖόν τι θηρίον κεκλημένον, μόνον ἵνα τελευτήσῃ ὧδε πρὸς ὠφέλειαν ἡμῶν. Ἑκάστη κίνησις ἔψοφει. Οἱ ἅμματα ὑπὸ τοῖς ποσίν μου ἔτριζον, οἱ ψόφοι τοιοῦτοι ἠχοῦντες διὰ τοίχων πανδοκείου τρίτῃ ὥρᾳ νυκτός, ὅτε αἱ κλινοστρωμάτων ἐλατῆρες τὰς ἰωδεῖς ὠιδὰς ἄδουσιν.

Μεσογείως, ἐπέβην ἐπὶ σανίδα ἔτι μίαν, ἢ ὃ σανίδος λόγον εἶχεν, ὀστοῦν ἓν ἀπὸ ζῴου, ὃ ἴσως οὐ σοφὸν ἦν σφάξαι. Τὸ ὀστοῦν ἐνέδωκεν, ἔρρηξε καὶ ὁ ἀριστερὸς πούς μου κατέδυ μέχρι τοῦ ἀστραγάλου. Ἡ ἄβυσσος τὴν κνήμην μου συνέλαβε μετὰ τῆς προθυμίας μάμμης ἥτις ἄρτι ἔμαθε τὸν υἱωνὸν ἥξειν ἐπὶ δεῖπνον.

Σὴς τις, ἴσως μεθύων ἐκ ζυμωθέντος νέκταρος, τῷ μετώπῳ μου προσέκρουσε. Τὰς ἀεροβατικὰς ἀτάξεις ἐρράπισα, αἱ πτέρυγες αὐτοῦ ἐβόων "Εὐτ! Εὐτ!" φωνῇ ἥτις μόνον δυσθυμοῦντι ἔλφῳ ἀνήκειν ἐδύνατο.

Τὸν χιτῶνά μου ἐψηλάφησα. Εἰς τὸν κόλπον μου, δάκτυλοι ἐρευνῶντες, δράκοντος ὀδόντα εὗρον, ψυχρόν, τραχύν, καὶ κόμβον ἕνα, τὸν προπηδήσαντα πρότερον. Ὁ ὀδοὺς ἐνείλητο ἐν τῇ πτυχῇ τοῦ κόλπου. Ἔδει εἶναι τοῦτον ὃν ἐκλέψας παρὰ καπήλου ἐν Βρίῳ ἀντὶ λαγύνου ῥόμβου, ἀναμφιβόλως.

Ἐπειράθην ἐξελκύσαι αὐτόν. Αὐθάδες πρᾶγμα! Ἀντέστη, ὑφάσματι ληφθείς, τὴν ὑπομονήν μου δοκιμάζων. Εἷλκον αὐτὸν βραδέως, βραδέως, βραδέως, ὡς ξίφος. Τέλος, ὁ ὀδοὺς ἐξῆλθε, ξανθὸς καὶ κακοῦργος.

Ἡ σχοῖνος δεσμοῦσα τὸν ἀστράγαλόν μου, παχεῖα ὡς ὄφις. Τὴν ἀκμὴν τοῦ ὀδόντος κατὰ τῆς κανναβίνου τραχείας πλοκῆς ἔθηκα, ἐκείνων τῶν ἰνῶν συμπεπλεγμένων ἐν τῷ οἰήματι ἰσχύος, καὶ ἔπριον. Πρόσω καὶ ὀπίσω, ὁ ὀδοὺς τρίβων, τρώγων, σχίζων ἶνα κατὰ ἶναν.

Τέλος ἡ σχοῖνος διέστη. Ἡ γέφυρα μικρόν τι ἔκαμψεν. Ἡ ἄβυσσος κάτω με ἐθεώρει μετ᾽ ὑπομονῆς, εἰδυῖα ὅτι ἡ βαρύτης οὐδέποτε λήθεται συναντήσεως.

Ὁ πούς μου ἀνεσπάσθη ἐλεύθερος, ἀνερροφήθη ἐκ τοῦ ὀστώδους χάσματος. Ἐσφάλην πρόσω, ἐμαυτὸν ἐπὶ τῶν λοιπῶν σχοίνων τῆς γεφύρας ἔλαβον, ἐκείνων τῶν νεύρων ἔτι τῷ σκοπῷ προσεχομένων.

Ἡ σχοῖνος ἣν ἔτεμον, χαλαρὰ νῦν ἐκρέματο, κρεμαμένη ὡς δάκτυλος ἐν ἐπιπλήξει σειόμενος.

Πρόσω, τὸ νέφος λεπίζεσθαι ἤρξατο λεπτοῖς τρέμουσι στρώμασιν, ἀποκαλύπτον τὴν πέραν ὄχθην: τμῆμα γῆς ἐπίπεδον ὡς δέλτος βύβλου καὶ χλωρὸν ὡς φαρμακίδος χλεύασμα.

Τίνες λόγοι ἄμεινον ἁρμόσειαν νέφει τελικῶς, εἰ μὴ δημοκρατία σκιῶν;

Ὄπισθέν μου, ἡ γέφυρα μετέωρος ἔρρηξεν ὡς ἂν ἀπειρήκει γέφυρα εἶναι καί, ἐν τελευταίᾳ πράξει ἀποστασίας, εἰς χάρτινον ἀεροπλάνον συνεπτύχθη καὶ ἑαυτὴν εἰς τὸν χάσκοντα λαιμὸν τοῦ χάσματος ἔρριψεν. Πέτραι τὰς οὔλας ἔτριζον ἐπὶ τοῖς πίπτουσι συντριμμάτοις.

Ἐπὶ τῆς πέραν ὄχθης ἵσταμαι, ἔτι τοῖς μέλεσι προσηρτημένος, ἔτι πλήρως ἠμφιεσμένος, πλὴν τοῦ ἀπολομένου κόμβου.

Νεοσσιὰ κοράκων πρόσω καθημένη, τῆς γεφύρας καταπιπτούσης ᾐσθάνετο, καὶ πᾶσα ἡ ἀγέλη ἐξέρρηξεν. Τὰ ῥάμφη ὁμοῦ ἠνοίχθη, κρώζοντα οὐ θανάτου οἰωνόν, ἀλλὰ μιμουμένην, ξυλοφωνικὴν τρυλλίδα τῆς γεφύρας ἑαυτὴν ἀτομιζούσης εἰς μωσαϊκὸν κλάδων καὶ ὀστέων.

Αἱ πτέρυγες ἔκραξαν καὶ ἑαυτὰς εἰς τὸν ἀέρα ἔρριψαν, ἐκεῖ στιγμὴν ἐμέτωροι ἔμειναν καὶ εἰς τὴν χάσκουσαν μέλαιναν τραχεῖαν ἐβύθισαν, ἥτις νῦν τὰ λείψανα ἐγαργάριζε μετὰ τῆς ἡδονῆς ἀνθρωποφάγου ζωμοῦ.

Ἡ γῆ ὧδε, βομβεῖν ἐδόκει σιγῇ. Τὸ νέφος ἐντελῶς διελέλυτο. Ὁ ἀὴρ καθαρὸς ἦν. Τὸ φῶς λίαν λαμπρὸν ἦν.

** Κεφάλαιον Α': Ἡ τῆς γεφύρας διάβασις

Τὰ δένδρα, ἐκεῖνα τὰ κεκαμμένα νεῦρα φλοιοῦ, ἐν τῇ ὄψει μου ἐσαλεύοντο, αἱ ῥίζαι τὴν γῆν ἐξύοντο, οἱ στελέχεοι πρὸς τὸ ἔσω ἐκλίνοντο ὥσπερ γαργύλου μειδίαμα, οἱ σκολιοὶ κλάδοι τὴν γῆν ἐκονδυλίζοντο ἐν μυκτηρισμῷ προσκυνήσεως. Πρόσθεν, ἡ Σχοῖνος, ἐκείνη ἡ αὐθάδης χλωρὰ γαστὴρ χοίρου, γελᾷ γέλωτα ᾧ οὐκ ἐπίστευον.

Ἐγώ, Φροδίων ὁ Βακχίνιος, ὁ φέρων τὸ... ὦ, μηδὲν μέλοι!

Ἐβάδιζον διὰ τῆς ὁδοῦ, εἰς στενὸν τόννηλον ἀκανθῶν, ὧν αἱ ῥάβδοι ἐσπείροντο φρίσσουσαι ὥσπερ ἀρχαίου ἐχίνου ἀκτένιστος μύσταξ τοὺς ἀγκιστροειδεῖς ἄκανθας ἐκακκάβιζεν. Αἱ αἰχμαὶ τοὺς ἀστραγάλους μου ἐδάκνον, ἓν σχίσμα τὸν χιτῶνά μου συνέλαβεν καὶ κόμβος ἐξεπήδησεν ὥσπερ πυροβόλον.

Ὁ πηλὸς ὑπὸ ποδῶν στρέφεται, ἕκαστον βῆμα νέαν ῥυτίδα ῥύπου γεννᾷ. Τὰ αἰγώδη σανδάλιά μου, ποτὲ γαῦρα, νῦν πηλῷ τῷ χρώματι σαπροῦ λεμονίνου ψωμίου πεπηγμένα, κατέσυρόν με ἐν διαμαρτυρίαις ὡς εἰ ἡ γῆ αὐτὴ συνώμνυε τιμολογῆσαί με κατὰ βῆμα. Λακτίζω τὸν βρυώδη ἰλύν, καὶ ὁ βόρβορος νῦν ὀλισθαίνει καὶ τρίζει ὥσπερ δύο ἠτιμασμένοι ῥήτορες.

Παχεῖα ὡς ὑγρὸν σιμβλίον καπήλισσης, ἡ ὁμίχλη προσκυλίεται. Οὐχ ἡ συνήθης ὑγρὰ ἀχλὺς τῆς Σχοίνου ἀλλ' ὑγρόν, σαρκῶδες πρᾶγμα ὃ τῷ τραχήλῳ μου προσκολλᾶται καὶ ψιθυρίζει τοῖς νεκροῖς τόνοις πνιγέντος ὀργάνου ναοῦ. Ἓν δένδρον εἰς τὴν ὁμίχλην ἐχώλευσεν, τὰ φύλλα νῦν πτερυγίζοντα ὥσπερ χίλιαι διαρρηγνύμεναι γλῶσσαι.

Φρῦνος ἐπὶ ἀνατετραμμένου λιθίνου λουτροῦ ὀρνέων καθήμενος, ἐκέκραγεν τῇ ἐξουσίᾳ προφήτου, τὴν δίψαν μου μυκτηρίζων. Ὁ λαιμὸς αὐτοῦ στίλβων ῥοδόχρους φυσητήρ, φωνὴ κρωγμὸς ὁ παλλόμενος, "Ὄμβρος! Ὄμβρος!" Ἠμύησα τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς. Πρὸς τῶν ἄστρων, ἦν ἐκεῖνος ὁ ὄρνις ἐνταῦθα πρὸ δύο καρδιακῶν παλμῶν; Οὔ φημι.

Ἡ ὁδὸς πρόσθεν σχίζεται, ἀλλ' ἀμφότεραι σχίσεις πρὸς τὴν αὐτὴν κατασκευὴν ἄγουσιν. Ἐκ τῆς ὁμίχλης γεγεννημένη, γέφυρα συμπεπλεγμένων ἐντέρων, ὑπερτείνουσα χάσματος οὗ ἡ γῆ ἐχῄνωσεν ὥσπερ γαστριμάργου στόμα. Ἀμφότεραι ὅμοιαι. Ἀμφότεραι σηπομένοις φύλλοις συμπεφυρμέναι. Ἀριστερὰν ἢ δεξιὰν εἱλόμην; Ἡ ἀπόφασις ὑπὸ τοῦ ποδός μου ἐγένετο.

Τὰ νευρώδη σχοινία τῆς γεφύρας στενάζοντα ὡς εἴ τι ἀρχαῖον θηρίον κέκληται, ἵνα αὐτόθι ἀποθάνῃ πρὸς τὴν ἡμετέραν ὠφέλειαν. Ἑκάστη κίνησις ἐχλίαινεν. Οἱ δεσμοὶ ὑπὸ τοὺς πόδας μου ἔτριζον, τὰ εἴδη τῶν ψόφων διὰ τειχῶν πανδοκείου περὶ τὴν τρίτην ὥραν νυκτὸς ἠχοῦντα, ὅτε αἱ κλίναι τοὺς κατιωμένους ὕμνους ᾄδουσιν.

Μέσῃ τῇ διαβάσει, ἐπέβην ἐπὶ μίαν σανίδα ἔτι, ἢ ὅ τι σανίδα ἐνομίζετο, μόνον ὀστοῦν ἀπὸ ζῴου, ὃ σφαγῆναι ἴσως σοφὸν οὐκ ἦν. Τὸ ὀστοῦν ἐνέδωκε, διεράγη καὶ ὁ ἀριστερὸς πούς μου εἰς τὸν ἀστράγαλον κατέδυ. Ἡ ἄβυσσος τὴν κνήμην μου συνέλαβε τῇ προθυμίᾳ μάμμης ἥτις ἄρτι ἔμαθε τὸν ἔκγονον πρὸς δεῖπνον ἐρχόμενον.

Σὴς, ἴσως μεθύων ἐπὶ ζυμωθέντι νέκταρι, τῷ μετώπῳ μου προσέκρουσε. Τὴν ἀερίαν ἀκροβασίαν αὐτοῦ διήμυνα, αἱ πτέρυγες βοῶσαι "Εὖτ! Εὖτ!" φωνῇ ἥτις δυσαρέστου ἄλφοιο μόνον εἶναι ἠδύνατο.

Τὸν χιτῶνα ἐψηλάφησα. Εἰς τὸν κόλπον, δακτύλοις ἐρευνῶσι, δρακοντίαν ὀδόντα εὗρον, ψυχρόν, τραχύν, καὶ ἕνα κόμβον, τὸν προπηδήσαντα πρότερον. Ὁ ὀδοὺς ἐν τῷ πτυχίῳ τοῦ κόλπου ἐμπεπήγει. Ἔδει εἶναι τὸν ὃν ἀπὸ καπήλου ἐν Βρήᾳ ἀντὶ φιάλης οἴνου συκοφαντικῶς ἔλαβον, ἀναμφιβόλως.

Ἐπειράθην αὐτὸν ἐξελκύσαι. Αὐθάδες πρᾶγμα! Ἀντέστη, ὑφάσματι συλληφθέν, τὴν ὑπομονήν μου δοκιμάζον. Ἐσπασάμην αὐτὸν βραδέως, βραδέως, βραδέως, ὡς ξίφος. Τέλος, ὁ ὀδοὺς ἐφάνη, ξανθὸς καὶ πονηρός.

Τὸ σχοινίον τὸν ἀστράγαλον περιδήσαν, παχὺ ὡς ὄφις. Τὴν ἀκμὴν τοῦ ὀδόντος κατὰ τῆς κάνναβιν τραχείας πλοκῆς ἔθηκα, ἐκείνων τῶν ἰνῶν συνεστραμμένων ἐν τῇ οἰήσει ῥώμης, καὶ ἔπριζον. Δεῦρο κἀκεῖ, ὁ ὀδοὺς τρίβων, μασώμενος, ἶνα κατὰ ἶναν διασχίζων.

Τέλος τὸ σχοινίον διέστη. Ἡ γέφυρα μικρόν τι παρεχαύνωσεν. Ἡ κάτωθεν ἄβυσσος ὑπομονῇ με ἐθεᾶτο, εἰδυῖα ὅτι ἡ βαρύτης οὐδέποτε συνάντησιν ἐπιλανθάνεται.

Ὁ πούς μου ἐξεσπάσθη ἐλεύθερος, ἐκ τοῦ ὀστεΐνου χάσματος ἐξεμύχθη. Πρόσω ἐσφάλην, ἐμαυτὸν ἐπὶ τῶν λοιπῶν σχοινίων τῆς γεφύρας συνέλαβον, ἐκείνων τῶν νεύρων ἔτι τῷ σκοπῷ προσεχομένων.

Τὸ σχοινίον ὃ ἔτεμον, χαλαρὸν νῦν ἐκρέματο, αἰωρούμενον ὡς δάκτυλος ἐν ἀποδοκιμασίᾳ σειόμενος.

Πρόσθεν, ἡ ὁμίχλη ἤρξατο λεπτοῖς, φρισσούσαις στιβάσιν ἀπολέπεσθαι, τὴν πέραν ὄχθην ἀποκαλύπτουσα: τεμάχιον γῆς πλατὺ ὡς δέλτος χάρτου καὶ χλωρὸν ὡς μάγισσης σαρδόνιον.

Τίνες λόγοι μᾶλλον ὁμίχλῃ ἁρμόζοιεν, εἰ μὴ δημοκρατία σκιῶν;

Ὄπισθέν μου, ἡ γέφυρα μέσῳ ἀέρι διεράγη ὡς εἰ κοπιάσασα γεφύρα οὖσα καί, τελευταίᾳ πράξει ἀποστασίας, εἰς χαρτίνην βέλην ἐπτύχθη καὶ εἰς τὸ χῃνῶδες χάσμα ἑαυτὴν ἐρρίφθη. Πέτραι τοῖς οὔλοις τὰ πίπτοντα ἐμάσσοντο.

Ἐπὶ τῆς πέραν ὄχθης ἕστηκα, ἔτι τοῖς μέλεσι προσηρτημένος, ἔτι πλήρως ἠμφιεσμένος, χωρὶς τοῦ ἀπολομένου κόμβου.

Νεοττιὰ κοράκων πρόσθεν καθημένων, τῆς καταπιπτούσης γεφύρας προσέσχον, καὶ πᾶν τὸ σμῆνος ἐξέβρασεν. Τὰ ῥύγχη ὁμοῦ ἠνοίχθησαν, οὐ θανάτου οἰωνὸν κρώζοντα ἀλλὰ μιμούμενα, ξυλοφωνικὸν τριλλισμὸν τῆς γεφύρας ἀτομιζούσης ἑαυτὴν εἰς ψηφιδωτὸν κλάδων καὶ ὀστῶν.

Αἱ πτέρυγες ἔκραξαν καὶ εἰς τὸν ἀέρα ἑαυτοὺς ἔρριψαν, αὐτόθι στιγμὴν ἐμετεώριζον καὶ εἰς τὴν χαίνουσαν μέλαιναν ἀρτηρίαν κατέδυσαν, ἥτις νῦν τὰ λείψανα ἐγαργάριζεν τῇ ἡδονῇ ἀνθρωποφάγου ζωμοῦ.

Ἡ γῆ ἐνταῦθα, ἐδόκει σιγῇ βομβεῖν. Ἡ ὁμίχλη παντελῶς διεσκέδαστο. Ὁ ἀὴρ καθαρὸς ἦν. Τὸ φῶς λίαν λαμπρὸν ἦν.

** Κεφάλαιον Β΄: Ἡ Οἰκία τοῦ Σαμυίου

Προσῆλθον τῇ τῶν χομπίτων κώμῃ Λαμπρορρίζῳ τῇ προσκειμένῃ τῷ λόφῳ. Οἰκίαι, χώματα γῆς ἦσαν, γαστέρες ἐξογκωμέναι ἔγκυοι καπνοῦ καλαμίνης, αἱ θύραι κυκλοειδεῖς, ξύλον διεσχισμένον καὶ κολεοπτέρῳ ἐοικός. Θυρίδες ὡς ὀφθαλμοὶ ἐξορυχθέντες, αἱ δὲ ῥάχεις τῶν καπνοδόχων ἐκάμφθησαν κατὰ τὸν αὐχένα, πνιγόμεναι ὑπὸ τοῦ ἰδίου καπνοῦ.

Ἡ ὁδὸς πρὸς τὴν οἰκίαν τοῦ Σαμυίου ἑλίσσεται γραμματοειδῶς, ὡς ἂν εἰ ἡ γῆ αὐτὴ γοητείας ἔγραφεν. Βάθρα λίθινα ἐτετρίφατο λεῖα ὑπὸ δεκαετιῶν ποδῶν χομπιτικῶν, ἕκαστον ἄλλου ὕψους ὡς ἂν εἰ ὁ λιθουργὸς μεθύων ἐτετύχει, ἀπολυθείς, εἶτα ἐπανειλημμένος ἐξ οἴκτου.

"Ὦ Σαμύιε!" ἐκάλεσα, ἡ φωνή μου θραυομένη πρὸς τοῖς τοίχοις. Οὐδεμία ἀπόκρισις. Ἡ θύρα αὐτοῦ σίδηρον εἶχε λαβήν, κατιωμένην τὴν χροιὰν αἵματος ξηροῦ. Ἐκράτησα τὴν λαβήν. Ἔκαυσέ μου τὴν χεῖρα, ψυχρὰ ὡς χεὶρ χήρας ἐν ἀσπασμῷ θανάτου. Ὤθησα τὴν θύραν, ἐκέκραγεν τοὺς στρόφιγγας.

Κάτωθεν, ἐκ τινος ὑπὸ τοὺς σανίδας, ἦλθε ψόφος. "Ὁ ὑπόγειος. Ἔνθα τὰ ἀγαθὰ φύεται" ἐμυρμήρισα πρὸς ἐμαυτόν.

Κατέβην τὴν κλίμακα, τρύπανον ἑλικοειδὲς εἰς τὰ ἔντερα τῆς γῆς διατορηθέν, ἑλισσόμενον κάτω, ἕκαστον βαθμίδιον στενότερον τοῦ προτέρου.

Πίθοι παρὰ τοῖς τοίχοις παρετάττοντο, τρεῖς ὕψει ἐστιβασμένοι, τὸ ξύλον αὐτῶν ἐξογκωμένον ὑπὸ τῶν ὑγρῶν ὧν ἐδεσμεύοντο.

Ὁ Σαμύιος ἦν ἐκεῖ. Τὸ ἔδαφος, γῆ πεπατημένη, ᾠκίσθη ὑπὸ ἀποικίας μυκήτων, τὰ πίλια αὐτῶν ἀναπεπταμένα πρὸς πάσας τὰς ὁδούς, οἱ καυλοὶ ἑρπόμενοι διὰ τῆς γῆς, ἐν σχήμασιν ὑποδηλοῦσι νοῦν μέγαν ἢ μανίαν μεγάλην.

"Φροδίων! Φροδίων Βαγγίνη, σὺ ἡμίσεπτον πράσον!" ἡ φωνὴ τοῦ Σαμυίου ἐβρόντησεν.

"Ἰὼ Ζεῦ!" ἔκραξεν, ἀναβαίνων, ἡ κλῖμαξ τρίζουσα ἐν κλειδὶ ἣν μόνον αἱ αἴλουροι ἤκουον.

Ἐξήλθομεν ἐκ τοῦ σκότους καὶ ἤλθομεν πρὸς τὴν τράπεζαν, ἐκείνην τὴν ἀρχαίαν πλάκα ξύλου ἥτις ἐδέσποζε τοῦ μεγάλου οἴκου ὡς βωμός. Ὁ Σαμύιος ἐπορεύθη σύρων πρὸς τὸ μαγειρικὸν χωρίον, θύλακος ἐπὶ θύλακον ἀγγείων, ἕκαστον περιέχον ὑγρὰ ἢ στερεὰ ἐν διαφόροις βαθμίσι. Ἐξελέξατο ἓν ἀγγεῖον, ὑγρὸν ἠλέκτρινον ἔνδον, τοῦτο ὃ ἐκινεῖτο ὅτε οὐκ ἔδει κινεῖσθαι.

"Τοῦτο," ὁ Σαμύιος εἶπε, προκύπτων μετὰ τῆς σπουδῆς ἀνδρὸς ὃς ἄρτι ἀνεῦρε μύκητας καὶ καύσιμον καὶ πρὸς μαντείαν καύσιμον γενέσθαι δυνάμενον, "ἐστὶ μυκητικὸν δεῖπνον." Ὁ πώγων αὐτοῦ, φριχώδης σπορεοφόροις, ἐπτύετο σπόρους ὡς μικροὺς ἀλεξιπαραχυτιστὰς εἰς τὸ κενόν.

Ἔχεεν. Τὸ ὑγρὸν ἰλυῶδες ἐκ τοῦ ἀγγείου εἰς τὴν φιάλην, παχὺ ὡς μέλι, ἀτμὸς ἀνῄει, οὐκ ἀτμός, καπνὸς φέρων μεθ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ ὀσμὴν ἥτις ἦν μέρος γῆς, μέρος θανάτου, μέρος τι ἄλλο παντελῶς, τι ὃ τὰς τρίχας τῆς ῥινός μου ἐποίησεν ἑλιχθῆναι αὐτοφύλακα.

Ὁ Σαμύιος ὤθησε τὴν φιάλην διὰ τῆς τραπέζης πρός με. Διεσύρθη διὰ στρώματος κονίας, ἴχνος γλοιῶδες καταλιποῦσα ὄπισθεν.

"Αὔξει τὴν γλωσσικὴν ἀκρίβωσιν," εἶπον, ῥοφῶν ἐκ τῆς φιάλης.

"Οὐκ ἔστιν ἐκεῖνο τὸ ὄνομα," ἀπεκρίνατο, τὸ δεῖπνον αὐτοῦ κλυδαζόμενον.

"Ἔστιν, ἐν γλώττῃ ἣν ἄρτι ἐποίησα" εἶπον, "ἀλλὰ ἔξεστι καὶ τῇ Θρομβολικῇ διαλέκτῳ ἀνήκειν, γλώττῃ λαλουμένῃ ὑπὸ τῶν ἰχθυανδρῶν τῆς Ὑφάλμυρου Θαλάσσης."

"Ὁ δακτύλιός μου κακοπατεῖ νεωστί, ὦ Σαμύιε," εἶπον, ἁρπάζων τὸν δακτύλιον μεταξὺ ἀντίχειρος καὶ δακτύλου ὡς ἄνθρακα ἔμψυχον. "Τὰς τελευταίας τρεῖς ἡμέρας, ἀφανίζει με εἰς τὸν τοιχοστόλισμον ὅτε πειρῶμαι ἄριστον ἐσθίειν. Φρόντισον, τὸ ὀπτὸν καὶ τὸ γλύκυμμα, ἡμιφάγον, καὶ παππαῖ, οὐκ εἰμὶ ἐκεῖ. Τὰ παστινάκιά μου ἐμείναντο ἐν τῷ ἀέρι, ἐρωτῶντα ποῦ ὁ δεσπότης αὐτῶν ἔφυγεν." Ἔκρουσα τὸν δακτύλιον ἐπὶ τῆς τραπέζης. "Ἐνιαυτὸν ἐφόρουν τὸν δακτύλιον ὡς δεύτερον δέρμα. Νῦν δέ, ἐστι καπρικώδης. Χθές, εἴασέ με ὁραθῆναι ὑπὸ κόρακος, ὦ Σαμύιε! Αἰσχρὸς κορακίας ὃς ἔκλεψέ μου τὸν πῖλον!"

Ὁ Σαμύιος ἀνέλαβε τὸν δακτύλιον, παρατηρῶν αὐτὸν ὡς μάγειρος ἐξετάζει κρέας ἀμφίβολον. Ἔστρεψεν αὐτόν. Ἐκράτησε πρὸς τὸ τοῦ λύχνου φῶς. Ἡ φλὸξ ἐκάμφθη περὶ αὐτόν.

"Φροδίων," εἶπεν, "τοῦτο τὸ σὸν πρᾶγμα, ἦλεκτρόνικόν ἐστιν, ἆρ᾽ οὔ; Περιφοράδας ἔχει. Μικροθαυματολογίαν. Ἴσως τρέχει δαίμοσι μικροῖς δεδεσμευμένοις ἐν σιλικίῳ. Οἱ δαίμονες ἐκεῖνοι ὀκνηροὶ γίνονται, ὅλον τὸ σύστημα πίπτει. Νευρόδεσμα καὶ τεχνίδια ἔχει ἃ οὐδὲ οἶδας;"

"Μήπως ἔοικα μηχανικῷ; Τί οἶδα περὶ τεχνοβαρβαροφιλυρίας μαγείας;" ἀπέκροτησα, πλήττων τὸν δακτύλιον ἐπὶ τῆς τραπέζης. Ἐκυλίσθη ὡς κάνθαρος μεθύων. "Οὐκ ἔστιν ἀρτοφρύκτης, ὦ Σαμύιε. Ἔστι μηχάνιον ἐκ Μορδόρας. Πώποτ᾽ ἤκουσας Μορδόρας; Ποιοῦσι μαγείαν ἰδιοποίητον ἀνθρώποις οἳ θέλουσιν ἀφανισθῆναι."

Προσέκυψεν, ἡ ἀναπνοὴ αὐτοῦ ὀξεῖα μυκητικοῦ δείπνου. "Μορδόρα; Ὡς ἐν, ἡ Μορδόρα; Μελανομαγικὴ χειροτεχνία;"

"Ὡς ἐν ἡ μόνη ἑταιρεία ἡ πωλοῦσα πράγματα ἀνθρώποις οἳ οὐκ ἐρωτήσουσιν," εἶπον. "Ἡ ἀναγγελία ὑπέσχετο 'Ἀφάνεια Ἐγγυημένη'." Ἀνέλαβον τὸν δακτύλιον, ἐκράτησα πρὸς τὸ τοῦ λύχνου φῶς. "Ὁ ἐμπορικὸς εἶχεν ὀδόντας ἀρίστους. Πειστικοὺς σφόδρα ὀδόντας."

"Ἴσως σε δεῖ τηλεφωνῆσαι αὐτοῖς. Ἴσως ὁ γρεμλίνος σου ἁπλῶς ὑποπρόγραμμα στερεῖται. Τηλεφώνησον τῇ ἑταιρείᾳ. Εἰπὲ αὐτοῖς τὸν δακτύλιόν σου ἐλαττωματικὸν εἶναι, ὅτι ποιεῖ τὴν ἀφάνειάν σου ἀσύμμετρον."
** Κεφάλαιον Β': Ἡ Οἰκία Σαμυίου

Προσῆλθον τῇ κώμῃ τῶν χαμαιζήλων, ἥτις Λαμπρόρριζα καλεῖται, κρεμαμένῃ τῷ λόφῳ. Οἰκίαι, γῆς ὄγκοι ἦσαν, γαστέρες πεφυσημέναι κύουσαι καπνὸν σιφώνιον, αἱ θύραι κυκλοειδεῖς, ξύλον διερρηγμένον καὶ κανθαρόφρυκτον. Θυρίδες ὡς ὀφθαλμοὶ ἐξορυγμένοι, καὶ αἱ ῥάχεις τῶν καπνοδόχων κεκαμμέναι κατὰ τὸν αὐχένα, ἀποπνιγόμεναι ὑπὸ τοῦ ἰδίου καπνοῦ.

Ἡ ὁδὸς πρὸς τὴν οἰκίαν Σαμυίου στρέφεται καλλιγραφικῶς, ὡς εἰ αὐτὴ ἡ γῆ ἐπᾴδει γοητείας. Βαθμίδες λιθίναι λελειασμέναι ὑπὸ δεκαετιῶν χαμαιζήλων ποδῶν, ἑκάστη ἄλλου ὕψους ὡς εἰ ὁ λιθουργὸς μεθύων ἦν, ἐκπεσών, εἶτα πάλιν μισθωθεὶς ἐξ οἴκτου.

"Σαμύιε!" ἐβόησα, τῆς φωνῆς μου κατακλωμένης πρὸς τοῖς τοίχοις. Οὐδεμία ἀπόκρισις. Ἡ θύρα αὐτοῦ σιδηρᾶν λαβὴν εἶχεν, ἰοβαφῆ τὸ χρῶμα ξηροῦ αἵματος. Ἔλαβον τὴν λαβήν. Ἔκαυσέ μοι τὴν παλάμην, ψυχρὰν ὡς χήρας χεὶρ ἐν χειρασπασίᾳ θανάτου. Ὤθησα τὴν θύραν· ἐστρίγξαντο οἱ γίγγλυμοι.

Κάτωθεν, ἐκ τοῦ ὑπὸ τοὺς σανιδώματας, ἦχος ἦλθεν. "Ὁ ὑπόγειος. Ὅπου τὰ ἀγαθὰ φύεται" ἐφθεγξάμην ἐμαυτῷ.

Κατέβην τὴν κλίμακα, ἅμιλλα εἰς τὰ ἔγκατα τῆς γῆς τετορευμένην, ἑλικοειδῶς κατιοῦσαν, ἑκάστη βαθμὶς στενοτέρα τῆς προτέρας.

Πίθοι παρὰ τοῖς τοίχοις ἐστοιχίζοντο, τρεῖς τὸ ὕψος, τὸ ξύλον αὐτῶν πεφυσημένον ὑπὸ τῶν ὑγρῶν ἃ ἐφυλάττετο.

Σαμύιος ἐκεῖ ἦν. Τὸ ἔδαφος, πατητὴ γῆ, ὑπὸ ἀποικίας μυκήτων κατείληπτο, οἱ πῖλοι αὐτῶν πανταχόσε ῥιπιζόμενοι, οἱ καυλοὶ ὀφεοειδῶς διὰ τῆς γῆς ἕρποντες, ἐν σχήμασιν ὑποδεικνύουσιν ἢ μεγάλην σύνεσιν ἢ μεγάλην μανίαν.

"Φροδίων! Φροδίων Βαγγινῆ, σὺ ἡμίσεσηπὼς πράσον!" ἡ φωνὴ Σαμυίου ἐβρόντησεν.

"Νὴ τὸν Δία!" ἔκραξεν, ἀναβαίνων, τῶν κλιμάκων τριζουσῶν ἐν τόνῳ ὃν μόνον αἱ αἴλουροι ἀκούουσιν.

Ἀνήλθομεν ἐκ τοῦ σκότους καὶ προσήλθομεν τῇ τραπέζῃ, τῇ ἀρχαίᾳ πλακὶ ξυλίνῃ ἥτις ἐκυρίευεν τοῦ μεγάρου ὡς βωμός. Σαμύιος ἐβάδισεν πρὸς τὴν μαγειρικὴν χώραν αὐτοῦ, στοῖχος ἐπὶ στοίχῳ κεραμίων, ἕκαστον περιέχον ὑγρὰ ἢ στερεὰ ἐν διαφόροις καταστάσεσι. Ἐξελέξατο ἓν κεράμιον, ἠλεκτροειδὲς ὑγρὸν ἐντός, ὕλην ἥτις ἐκινεῖτο ὅτε οὐκ ἔδει κινεῖσθαι.

"Τοῦτο," Σαμύιος εἶπεν, προσκλινόμενος μετὰ σπουδῆς ἀνδρὸς νεωστὶ εὑρόντος ὅτι οἱ μύκητες δύνανται εἶναι καὶ καῦσις καὶ ὕλη μαντείας, "ἐστὶν μυκητόποτον". Ὁ πώγων αὐτοῦ, φρίσσων σποραγγιοφόροις, πτύων σπόρους ὡς μικροὺς παραπηδιστὰς εἰς τὸ κενόν.

Ἐξέχεεν. Τὸ ὑγρὸν ἐρρύη ἐκ τοῦ κεραμίου εἰς τὴν κύλικα, παχὺ ὡς μέλι, ἀτμὸς ἀνέβαινεν, οὐκ ἀτμός, καπνὸς φέρων ὀσμὴν ἥτις ἦν μέρος γῆς, μέρος θανάτου, μέρος ἄλλο τι πάντως, τι ὃ τὰς τρίχας μου τῆς ῥινὸς ἐποίει στρέφεσθαι πρὸς αὐτοφυλακήν.

Σαμύιος ὤθησεν τὴν κύλικα διὰ τῆς τραπέζης πρὸς ἐμέ. Ὠλίσθησεν διὰ στρώματος κονιορτοῦ, λιπαρὰν ἴχνην καταλιποῦσα.

"Ἐπαυξάνει τὴν γλωσσικὴν ἀκριβολεξίαν," εἶπον, ῥοφήσας ἐκ τῆς κυλίκης.

"Οὐχ ὑπάρχει τοῦτο τὸ ὄνομα," ἀπεκρίνατο, τοῦ ποτοῦ αὐτοῦ κλυζομένου.

"Ὑπάρχει, ἐν γλώσσῃ ἣν ἐποίησα ἄρτι" εἶπον, "ἀλλὰ μάλιστα ἀνήκει τῇ Θρομβολικῇ διαλέκτῳ, γλώσσῃ λαλουμένῃ ὑπὸ τῶν ἰχθυανθρώπων τῆς Ὑπαλμυρᾶς Θαλάσσης."

"Ὁ δακτύλιός μου ἀδρανεῖ ἐσχάτως, Σαμύιε," εἶπον, ἁρπάσας τὸν δακτύλιον μεταξὺ ἀντίχειρος καὶ δείκτου ὡς εἰ ἄνθραξ ζῶν ἦν. "Τρεῖς ἡμέρας, πεποίηκέ με ἀφανῆ εἰς τὴν τοιχογραφίαν ἐν ᾧ πειρῶμαι ἀριστᾶν. Σκέψαι, ἄρτος καὶ γλυκύτης, ἡμιβεβρωμένα, καὶ παπαῖ, οὐκ εἰμὶ ἐκεῖ. Τὰ σίσαρά μου ἐμένοντο ἐν τῷ ἀέρι, ἐρωτῶντα ποῦ ὁ δεσπότης αὐτῶν ἔφυγεν." Ἔκρουσα τὸν δακτύλιον ἐπὶ τῇ τραπέζῃ. "Ἐνιαυτὸν ἐφόρουν τὸν δακτύλιον ὡς δευτέραν ἐπιδερμίδα. Ἀλλὰ νῦν, ὀργίλος ἐστίν. Χθές, εἴασέ με ὁραθῆναι ὑπὸ κοράκου Σαμύιε! Αἱματοβόρου κορακοειδοῦς ὃς ἔκλεψέ μου τὸν πῖλον!"

Σαμύιος ἀνέλαβεν τὸν δακτύλιον, παραβλέπων αὐτὸν ὥσπερ μάγειρος ἐξετάζει ἀμφίβολον κρέας. Ἔστρεψεν. Ἔσχεν πρὸς τὸ λυχνόφως. Ἡ φλὸξ ἐκάμφθη περὶ αὐτόν.

"Φροδίων," εἶπεν, "τοῦτο τὸ σόν, ἠλεκτρονικόν ἐστιν, ἆρ' οὐκ; Ἔχει περιόδους. Μικροθαυματουργίαν. Ἴσως τρέχει ἐπὶ μικρῶν δαιμόνων ἐν πυριτίῳ φυλακισμένων. Οἱ δαίμονες ἐκεῖνοι ῥᾳθυμοῦσι, πᾶν τὸ σύστημα καταρρεῖ. Ἔχει νεῦρα καὶ τεχνάσματα ἃ οὐκ οἶσθα;"

"Δοκῶ σοι μηχανοποιὸς εἶναι; Τί οἶδα περὶ τεχνομαγείας φλυαρώδους;" ἐμάχεσα, ῥάψας τὸν δακτύλιον ἐπὶ τὴν τράπεζαν. Ἐκυλίσθη ὡς κάνθαρος μεθύων. "Οὐκ ἔστιν ἀρτοφρύκτης, Σαμύιε. Ἔστιν τέχνασμα ἐκ Μορδόρων. Ἤκουσας Μορδόρων ποτέ; Ποιοῦσιν ἰδιοποίητον μαγείαν τοῖς βουλομένοις ἀφανίζεσθαι."

Προσέκλινεν, ἡ πνοὴ αὐτοῦ ὀξεῖα μυκητοπότου. "Μόρδοροι; Ὡς ἐν, Οἱ Μόρδοροι; Μελανομαγείας κατασκευή;"

"Ὡς ἐν ἡ μόνη ἑταιρία ἡ πωλοῦσα τοῖς μὴ ἐρωτῶσιν," εἶπον. "Ἡ διαφήμισις ὑπέσχετο 'Ἀφάνεια Ἐγγυημένη'." Ἀνέλαβον τὸν δακτύλιον, ἔσχον πρὸς τὸ λυχνόφως. "Ὁ πωλητὴς εἶχεν ἄριστους ὀδόντας. Πειστικοὺς πάνυ ὀδόντας."

"Ἴσως δεῖ σε καλεῖν αὐτούς. Ἴσως ὁ γρεμλῖνός σου ἐνδεὴς ἐστιν ἐνσταλμάτων. Κάλεσον τὴν ἑταιρίαν. Εἰπὲ αὐτοῖς ὅτι ὁ δακτύλιός σου ἐλλιπής ἐστιν, ὅτι ποιεῖ τὴν ἀφάνειάν σου ἀσύμμετρον."

** Κεφάλαιον Τρίτον: Ἡ Μορδώρεια Ἑταιρεία

Ὁ τηλέφωνος, θηρίον κυκλοφορικόν ὄν, ἐκάθητο ἐπὶ τῆς τραπέζης τοῦ Σαμυίου, μέλας βακελίτης, ὁ σπάρτος αὐτοῦ ἐντέροις ὅμοιος ἐστραμμένος, ὁ δέκτης βαρὺς ὡς ῥόπαλον κρανίοις πεποιημένον.

Ἐκύκλωσα. Ἕκαστος ἀριθμὸς ὑπόσχεσις ἦν, ὁ δάκτυλός μου τὰς κυκλικὰς ὀπὰς πιέζων, ὁ μηχανισμὸς τὰ ἔγκατα ἑαυτοῦ ταράττων, ἑκάστη περιστροφὴ αἰὼν μικρός, κλικ κλικ κλικ, πέψις μηχανική τις, ὁ τροχὸς ἀναχωρῶν μετὰ τῆς ἀντιστάσεως δημίου ἀκουσίου.

Κωδωνισμός. Κωδωνισμός. Κωδωνισμός.

"Χαίρετε εἰς τὴν Μορδώρειον Συνδρομὴν Πελατῶν, ὅπου τὸ σκότος ὑμῶν ἡμέτερον ἔργον ἐστί," γυνή τις ἀντιπρόσωπος ἐξώλισθε διὰ τοῦ ἑτέρου πέρατος. Λεία ὡς ἀρσενικὸν ἐν μέλιτι. "Ὄνομά μοι Λυργάθρα, τὸν τῆς λόγου ἀριθμὸν παρέχετε, παρακαλῶ."

Ἀπεκάθηρα τὸν φάρυγγα, πτύελον ἐκεῖ κείμενον ὡς πάροικος ἀρνούμενος ἔξωσιν. "Λόγος ἑπτακόσιοι ἑβδομήκοντα τρεῖς διὰ Β διὰ ἐννέα. Φροδίων Βάκχινος, ὁ κτησάμενος δακτύλιον ἀοράτου, τύπος Εἰδωλοποιὸς Τρισχίλιοι, σειριακὸς ἀριθμός..."

"Ἔχω τὴν δέλτον σου, ὦ Βάκχινε." Χάρται ἐτάραττοντο παρ' αὐτῇ, ὀξεῖς βίαιοι ψόφοι, ὡς ὀστέα ῥηγνύμενα τρόπῳ εὐτάκτῳ. "Πῶς δύναμαι σκοτίσαι τὴν ἡμέραν σου;"

"Ὁ δακτύλιός μου οὐχ ὑπηρετεῖ ὡς δεῖ καὶ χείρων γέγονε," ἀπεκρινάμην αὐτῇ, ἡ φωνὴ καταπίπτουσα εἰς συριγμὸν ψιθυριζόμενον. "Χθὲς πρωΐ, μέσον ἀφανισμοῦ, ἡμίσειά μου ἐνεπάγην. Τὸ ἡμίσυ τὸ ἄνω ἀόρατον, οἰχόμενον, ἐκλελοιπὸς τὸν τόπον, τὸ ἡμίσυ τὸ κάτω φανερὸν ὡς χυλός. Τὰ σκέλη μου ἔμειναν ὄπισθε. Ἐβάδιζον πρὸς τὴν ἑστίαν. Ἡψῶντο τὸ θείον ποτόν. Ἤχθοντο. Ὁ θώραξ μου ἑώρταζεν εἰς τὸ μεταφυσικὸν βασίλειον, ἐν ᾧ τὰ σφυρά μου τὴν χύτραν ἐτάρασσον!"

Σιγή. Εἶτα φάρυγγος κάθαρσις, βὴξ ἐπαγγελματική.

"Ὦ Βάκχινε, ἐπιτρέψατέ μοι ἀναβαλεῖν σε στιγμὴν μίαν..."

"Μένε, μή..."

Μουσικὴ προσέβαλε τὸν ὠτὸς πόρον μου. Οὐ μουσική, τῷ ὄντι. Μέλη ἀναβατηρίων πεποιημένα ἐπὶ τῷ δοκοῦντι συμφωνίᾳ ἐξ ἐντέρων αἰλούρων κατεσκευασμένῃ, λύραι πνιγόμεναι μέσον φθόγγου, κιθάραι δακρύουσαι ἐπὶ ἐλέῳ.

Ἔθλιψα τὸν δέκτην ἰσχυρότερον πρὸς τὸ κρανίον. Ὄπισθε τῆς μουσικῆς, φωναί. Ἡ φωνὴ αὐτῆς, νῦν ἐσκιασμένη, χεὶρ κεκαλυμμένη ἐπὶ τὸ στομιαῖον, φωναί τινες διέρρευσαν. Χορὸς ὀρκικῶν ὀλολυγμῶν καὶ ἡ φωνὴ αὐτῆς, μακρὰν ἀλλ' ἀκουστή, προσφωνοῦσά τινα:

"Γρισνάκη! ΓΡΙΣΝΑΚΗ! Ὁ νέος ὄρκος, ὁ ἐκ τῆς Σειρᾶς Ἑβδόμης, τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐνεπάγη τῷ πυθμένι τοῦ λέβητος, ναί, τῷ πυθμένι, οὐχ ὁρᾷς οὗτος αἰσχίων ἔτι ἐστὶ τῶν λοιπῶν; Τί λέγεις 'ποῖος;' Ὁ κεκραγώς! Ναί, ἐκεῖνος. Οὔ, οὐ δυνάμεθα πωλεῖν αὐτὸν οὕτως. Οὐ μέλει μοι εἴ τις βούλοιτο ὄρκον ἐδαφοπρόσωπον, ἀπόλυσον αὐτὸν εἰς ἀμινοξέα καὶ ἐξ ἀρχῆς ποίησον. Χρῶ τῷ μεγάλῳ ἀγγείῳ. Τῷ βιομηχανικῷ ἀγγείῳ. Καὶ πρὸς τῆς τοῦ Σκοτεινοῦ Κυρίου φιλίας, τάραττε αὐτὸν τοῦτο τὸ χρόνον, μὴ μόνον ἐμβάλλε καὶ ἐλπίζε." Ὑγρὸς σαρκώδης ψόφος. "Ἆ ναί. Ὄγγ ὁ νέος χαλεπότητά τινα ἔχει." Κλαγγὴ μεταλλική. Ἄλλος χυλισμός. "Ἰδού. Πάντα βελτίω. Σῖγα. Ἀγαθὸς παῖς."

Ἔμεινα. Ὁ Σαμύιος ἐθεώρει, ῥοφῶν τὸ μυκητῶδες θείον ποτόν.

Ἡ μουσικὴ ἐκόπη. Ἡ φωνὴ αὐτῆς ἐπανῆλθε, λεία πάλιν.

"Εὐχαριστῶ σοι τῆς ἀναμονῆς, ὦ Βάκχινε. Συγγνώμην αἰτοῦμαι τῆς ἀναβολῆς. Πάσχομεν ὄγκους κλήσεων ὑψηλοτέρους τῶν συνήθων, καὶ προσέτι ἡ κατασκευαστικὴ ἡμῶν ψάμαθος πάσχει ὃ καλοῦμεν 'στιγμὴν ἀναδομήσεως προϊόντων.'"

"Περὶ τοῦ δακτυλίου μου..." ἠρξάμην.

"Ναί. Τὸ δίχα ὁρατότητος πρόβλημά σου. Ἀνέσπασα τὰ δεδομένα τοῦ δακτυλίου σου. Τύπος Εἰδωλοποιὸς Τρισχίλιοι, κτηθεὶς πρὸ ὀκτωκαίδεκα μηνῶν, ἐγγύησις ἐκλελοιπυῖα..."

"Ἐκλελοιπυῖα; Ἔδωκα νόμισμα ἀγαθὸν τῆς παρατεταμένης ἐγγυήσεως! Ὁ πωλητὴς τοῖς ἄριστοις ὀδοῦσιν, ὑπέσχετο..."

"Ὦ Βάκχινε." Ἡ φωνὴ αὐτῆς ὠξύνθη, μάχαιρα ἐλκυσθεῖσα ἐκ μαλακοῦ κολεοῦ. "Ἡ παρατεταμένη ἐγγύησις καλύπτει ἀποτυχίαν καταστροφικήν, οὐ φθορὰν ἀποδόσεως. Ὃ πάσχεις κέκληται 'φάσις ἀνώμαλος,' ἥτις πίπτει ὑπὸ τρῖψιν συνήθη."

"Συνήθη;" ἐβόησα, ὁ Σαμύιος πηδήσας τῷ πέρατι τῆς τραπέζης, τὸ μυκητῶδες θείον ποτὸν αὐτοῦ χεόμενον.

"Κύριε, ταπείνωσον τὴν φωνήν, παρακαλῶ. Συνίημι τὴν ἀγανάκτησίν σου. Ὅμως, τὰ ἐκτελεστικᾶς περιβαλλούσης γράμματα τοῦ δακτυλίου οὐκ εἰσὶ διαθέσιμα τῷ χρωμένῳ. Τὰ ἐντὸς ἔργα τοῦ δακτυλίου σου, ὁ διαγνωστικὸς καταρράκτης, ὁ θαυματουργικὸς σωρὸς ἰχνῶν, πάντα ἀνήκει τῇ Μορδωρείᾳ Βιομηχανίᾳ. Τοῦτο ἐπιτήδευμα ἀσφαλείας ἐστὶν εἰς κώλυσιν ἀντιμηχανολογίας τῶν ἰδιωτικῶν ἡμῶν ἀλγορίθμων ἀοράτου."

Ἔθλιψα τὸν δέκτην, οἱ κόνδυλοι λευκαινόμενοι, φαντασθεὶς ὅτι ὁ τράχηλος αὐτῆς ἦν, οὔ, οὔ, οὐχ ὁ τράχηλος αὐτῆς, ὁ τράχηλος τοῦ πωλητοῦ, οἱ ἄριστοι ὀδόντες ἐκεῖνοι ψοφοῦντες ἐν ᾧ ἔπνιγον αὐτόν. "Ἐπιτήδευμα ἀσφαλείας; Οὐδὲ ὁρᾶν δύναμαι τί λελωβημένον ἐστὶν τῷ ἰδίῳ μου δακτυλίῳ;"

"Ὀρθῶς. Τὰ γράμματα κεκρυπτογραφημένα εἰσὶν ἑπτακαίδεκα φοράς, χρώμενα δαιμονικοῖς κρύφοις οἵτινες ὑγροποιήσουσι τὸν ἐγκέφαλόν σου εἰ πειράσαις ἀναγνῶναι αὐτά. Τοῦτο πρὸς τὴν σὴν προστασίαν ἐστίν, ὦ Βάκχινε."

"Τὴν ἐμὴν προστασίαν." Ἐγέλασα, ὁ ψόφος ἀναξυόμενος τὸν φάρυγγα ὡς χάλιξ διὰ ὀχετηροῦ. "Ἡμιαόρατός εἰμι Τρίτῃ πρωΐ, καταπλήσσων τὸν γαλακτοπώλην εἰς καρδιακὴν ἀποπληξίαν, καὶ σύ με προστατεύεις;"

"Κύριε, δύναμαι τάξαι διαγνωστικὴν συνάντησιν. Ἡ ἐπόμενη διαθέσιμος ῥυθμὸς ἐστι..." χάρται πάλιν ταρασσόμενοι, ἐκεῖνος ὁ τῶν ὀστέων ῥηγμοῦ ψόφος, "...ἓξ ἑβδομάδας ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν, Τρίτῃ ἀπογεύματι, μεταξὺ τῆς δευτέρας καὶ ἕκτης ὥρας. Τις ἀφίξεται ἐξετάσων τὸν δακτύλιόν σου. Ὑπηρεσίας μισθὸς ἐστι τεσσαράκοντα χρυσοῖ νομίσματα, οὐκ ἀποδοτέον, πληρωτέον προκαταβολῇ."

"Ἓξ ἑβδομάδες; Τεσσαράκοντα χρυσοῖ νομίσματα;"

"Ἄλλως," συνέχισε, ἡ φωνὴ λεία ὡς ὁμολογία ἐξελκυσθεῖσα ὑπὸ βίᾳ, "δύναιο ἂν κτήσασθαι τὸν νέον ἡμῶν τύπον, τὸν Εἰδωλοποιὸν Τετρακισχιλίους. Ἔχει βελτιωμένην φασικὴν σταθερότητα, μειωμένην φασματικὴν διάρροιαν, καὶ δωρεὰν κατάρας ἀφαίρεσιν τὸν πρῶτον μῆνα."

"Βούλει με ἈΓΟΡΆΣΑΙ ἌΛΛΟΝ ΔΑΚΤΎΛΙΟΝ;"

"Ὁ Εἰδωλοποιὸς Τρισχίλιοι κληρονομικὸν προϊὸν ἐστιν, ὦ Βάκχινε. Οὐκέτι κατασκευάζομεν ἀντικατάστατα μέρη. Ἐν τινι καιρῷ, ἡ ἀναβάθμισις οἰκονομικωτέρα γίνεται τῆς ἐπισκευῆς."
** Κεφάλαιον Γ': Ἡ Μορδώρα Ἑταιρεία

Ὁ τηλέφωνος, στροφεῖον θηρίον ὄν, ἐκάθητο ἐπὶ τῆς Σαμυίου τραπέζης, μέλαν βακηλιτικόν, ὁ σπάρτος αὐτοῦ ἐστραμμένος ὡς ἔντερα, ὁ δεκτὴρ βαρὺς ὡς ῥόπαλον κρανίοις πεποιημένον.

Ἐστρόφησα. Ἕκαστος ἀριθμὸς συνθήκη τις, ὁ δάκτυλός μου βιαζόμενος εἰς τὰς στροφείου τρήσεις, ὁ μηχανισμὸς στρεφόμενος τὰ ἔντερα αὑτοῦ, ἑκάστη στροφὴ μικρὰ αἰωνιότης, κλικ κλικ κλικ, πεπτικὴ μηχανικὴ διεργασία, ὁ τροχὸς ἑλκόμενος ὀπίσω μετὰ τῆς ἀντιστάσεως δημίου ἀκουσίου.

Κώδων. Κώδων. Κώδων.

"Χαίρετε εἰς τὴν Μορδώρας Ὑποστηρικτικὴν Ὑπηρεσίαν, ἔνθα τὸ σκότος ὑμῶν ἡμέτερον ἔργον ἐστίν," γυνή τις ἀντιπρόσωπος ἐξώλισθησεν ἐκ τοῦ ἑτέρου τέρματος. Λεία ὡς ἀρσενικὸν ἐν μέλιτι. "Τοὔνομά μοι Λουργάθρα, τὸν λογαριασμοῦ ἀριθμόν, παρακαλῶ."

Ἐκάθηρα τὸν φάρυγγα, πτύελον ἐκεῖ κατασχόμενον ὡς μέτοικος ἀρνούμενος ἐξέλασιν. "Λογαριασμὸς ἑπτὰ ἑπτὰ τρία διὰ Β διὰ ἐννέα. Φροδίων Βάγγινς, ὠνητὴς ἑνὸς ἀοράτου δακτυλίου, τύπου Φασματοποιητικοῦ τρισχιλιοστοῦ, σειριακοῦ ἀριθμοῦ..."

"Ἔχω τὴν πινακίδα σου, ὦ Βάγγινς." Χάρται ἐψοφοῦντο παρ' αὐτῇ, ὀξέα βίαια ψοφήματα, ὥσπερ ὀστέα κλώμενα τρόπῳ εὐτάκτῳ. "Πῶς ἂν σκοτίσαιμι τὴν ἡμέραν σου;"

"Ὁ δακτύλιός μου οὐκ ἐνεργεῖ ὡς δεῖ καὶ χείρων γέγονεν," ἀπεκρινάμην αὐτῇ, φωνὴ καταβαίνουσα εἰς συριγμὸν ψιθυρισθέντα. "Χθὲς πρωΐ, μέσῃ ἀφανείᾳ, ἐπάγην ἡμίσειος. Τὸ ἄνω ἥμισυ ἀόρατον, οἰχόμενον, ἐκλελοιπὸς τοὺς τόπους, τὸ κάτω ἥμισυ φανερὸν ὡς χυλός. Τὰ σκέλη μου ἔμειναν ὄπισθεν. Ἐπορεύθησαν πρὸς τὴν ἐσχάραν. Ἥψησαν τὸ τσάϊον. Ἐπλήττοντο. Ὁ θώραξ μου ἑώρταζεν εἰς τὴν μεταφυσικὴν χώραν, τὰ δὲ σφυρά μου ἐκίνουν τὴν χύτραν!"

Σιγή. Εἶτα καθαρμὸς φάρυγγος, ἐπαγγελματικὸς βήξ.

"Ὦ Βάγγινς, ἀνάμεινόν με στιγμὴν μίαν..."

"Μένε, μή..."

Μουσικὴ προσέβαλε τὸν ἀκουστικόν μου πόρον. Οὐ μουσική, τῷ ὄντι. Μέλη ἀναβατήρια συντεθειμένα ἐπί τινος ὡς ἔοικεν ἁρμονίου πεποιημένου ἐξ αἰλούρων ἐντέρων, λύραι πνιγόμεναι μέσῃ νότῃ, κιθάραι δακρύουσαι ἐλέου χάριν.

Ἔθλιψα τὸν δεκτῆρα μᾶλλον πρὸς τὸ κρανίον. Ὄπισθε τῆς μουσικῆς, φωναί. Ἡ φωνὴ αὐτῆς, νῦν ἀμυδρά, χεὶρ κεκαλυμμένη ἐπὶ τοῦ φωνηστομίου, φωναί τινες διερρέοντο. Χορὸς ὀρκικῶν ὀλολυγμῶν καὶ ἡ φωνὴ αὐτῆς, μακρὰν ἀλλ' ἀκουστή, προσφωνοῦσά τινα:

"Γρισνάκη! ΓΡΙΣΝΑΚΗ! Ὁ νέος Ὄρκος, ὁ ἐκ τῆς Ἑβδόμης Παρτίδος, τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐπάγη ἐπὶ τοῦ πυθμένος τοῦ λέβητος, ναί, τοῦ πυθμένος, οὐχ ὁρᾷς τοῦτον αἰσχίονα ὄντα τῶν λοιπῶν; Τί λέγεις 'ποῖον;' Τὸν κραυγάζοντα! Ναί, ἐκεῖνον. Οὔ, οὐ δυνάμεθα πωλεῖν αὐτὸν οὕτως. Οὐ μέλει μοι εἴ τις ἂν βούλοιτο ἐδαφοπρόσωπον Ὄρκον, διάλυσον αὐτὸν εἰς ἀμινοξέας καὶ ἄρξαι ἐξ ἀρχῆς. Χρῆσαι τῷ μεγάλῳ ἀγγείῳ. Τῷ βιομηχανικῷ ἀγγείῳ. Καὶ πρὸς τοῦ Σκοτεινοῦ Δεσπότου, ἀνάμειξον τοῦτο τὴν φοράν, μὴ μόνον ἔμβαλε καὶ ἐλπίζων." Ὑγρὸν κρεῶδες σπλόρχ. "Ἆ ναί. Ὁ νέος Ὄγγος ἐνταῦθα δυσκολίαν ἔχει." Μεταλλικὸν κτύπημα. Ἄλλο σκουΐς. "Ἰδού. Πάντα βελτίω. Σσσσ. Ἀγαθὸς παῖ."

Ἔμεινα. Σαμύιος παρετήρει, ῥοφῶν τὸ μυκητικὸν αὑτοῦ τσάϊον.

Ἡ μουσικὴ ἐκόπη. Ἡ φωνὴ αὐτῆς ἐπέστρεψε, λεία πάλιν.

"Εὐχαριστῶ σοι τῆς ἀναμονῆς, ὦ Βάγγινς. Συγγνώμην αἰτοῦμαι τῆς ἀναβολῆς. Πλείονας κλήσεις τοῦ συνήθους πάσχομεν, καὶ προσέτι τὸ κατασκευαστικὸν ἡμῶν ἔδαφος πάσχει ὃ καλοῦμεν 'προϊοντικὴν ἀναδιαρθρωτικὴν στιγμήν.'"

"Περὶ τοῦ δακτυλίου μου..." ἠρξάμην.

"Ναί. Τὸ διχοτομικὸν ὁρατότητος πρόβλημά σου. Ἀνέσπασα τὰ δεδομένα τοῦ δακτυλίου σου. Τύπος Φασματοποιητικὸς τρισχιλιοστός, ὠνηθεὶς πρὸ ὀκτωκαίδεκα μηνῶν, ἐγγύησις ἐκλελοιπυῖα..."

"Ἐκλελοιπυῖα; Ἔδωκα νόμισμα ἀγαθὸν τῆς ἐκτεταμένης ἐγγυήσεως! Ὁ ἐμπορικὸς ἁνὴρ τοῖς ἀρίστοις ὀδοῦσιν, ἐπηγγείλατο..."

"Ὦ Βάγγινς." Ἡ φωνὴ αὐτῆς ὠξύνθη, μάχαιρα σπασθεῖσα ἐκ βελουδίνου κολεοῦ. "Ἡ ἐκτεταμένη ἐγγύησις καλύπτει καταστροφικὴν ἀποτυχίαν, οὐκ ἐπιδοτικὴν κατάπτωσιν. Ὃ πάσχεις ταξινομεῖται ὡς 'ἀνώμαλος φασισμός,' ὅστις πίπτει ὑπὸ κοινὴν τριβὴν καὶ φθοράν."

"Κοινήν;" ἐβόησα, Σαμύιος πηδήσας ἐπὶ τοῦ μακροῦ τῆς τραπέζης τέρματος, τὸ μυκητικὸν αὐτοῦ τσάϊον κλυζόμενον.

"Κύριε, ταπείνωσον τὴν φωνήν σου, παρακαλῶ. Συνίημι τὴν ἀγανάκτησίν σου. Πλὴν τὰ ἐκτελεστικὰ περιβάλλοντος ἡμερολόγια τοῦ δακτυλίου οὐκ ἔστι διαθέσιμα τῷ χρωμένῳ. Τὰ ἐντὸς ἔργα τοῦ δακτυλίου σου, ἡ διαγνωστικὴ καταρράκτις, τὸ θαυματουργικὸν στοιβαῖον ἴχνος, πάντα ἀνήκει τῇ Μορδώρᾳ Βιομηχανίᾳ. Τοῦτό ἐστιν ἀσφαλείας χαρακτηριστικόν, ἵνα κωλύῃ τὴν ἀντίστροφον τεχνολογίαν τῶν ἰδιοκτήτων ἀορασίας ἀλγορίθμων ἡμῶν."

Ἔθλιψα τὸν δεκτῆρα, οἱ κόνδυλοι λευκαινόμενοι, φαντασθεὶς αὐτὸν τὸν τράχηλον αὐτῆς εἶναι, οὔ, οὔ, οὐ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτῆς, τὸν τοῦ ἐμπορικοῦ τράχηλον, οἱ ἄριστοι ἐκεῖνοι ὀδόντες τρίζοντες ὡς ἔπνιγον αὐτόν. "Ἀσφαλείας χαρακτηριστικόν; Οὐδὲ ὁρᾶν δύναμαι τί ἐσφάλη τῷ ἰδίῳ δακτυλίῳ μου;"

"Ὀρθῶς. Τὰ ἡμερολόγια κεκρυπτογραφημένα εἰσὶν ἑπτακαιδεκάκις, δαιμονικαῖς κρυπτογραφίαις αἵτινες ὑγράναιεν ἂν τὸν ἐγκέφαλόν σου εἰ ἐπεχείρησας ἀναγιγνώσκειν αὐτά. Τοῦτο πρὸς τὴν σὴν προστασίαν ἐστίν, ὦ Βάγγινς."

"Τὴν ἐμὴν προστασίαν." Ἐγέλασα, ὁ ψόφος ξυόμενος ἀνὰ τὸν φάρυγγα μου ὡς χάλιξ διὰ ὀχετοῦ. "Ἡμιαόρατός εἰμι Τρίτῃ πρωΐ, ἐκπλήττων τὸν γαλακτοπώλην εἰς καρδιακὴν ἐπίληψιν, καὶ σύ με προστατεύεις;"

"Κύριε, δύναμαι ταξινομῆσαι διαγνωστικὴν συνάντησιν. Ἡ προσεχὴς διαθέσιμος χάσμη ἐστίν..." χάρται πάλιν ψοφούμενοι, ἐκεῖνο τὸ ὀστεοκλαστικὸν ἦχος, "...ἓξ ἑβδομάδων ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν, Τρίτῃ μετὰ μεσημβρίαν, μεταξὺ τῶν ὡρῶν δευτέρας καὶ ἕκτης. Τις ἀφίξεται ἐπισκοπῆσαι τὸν δακτύλιόν σου. Ἔστι τέλος ὑπηρεσίας τεσσαράκοντα χρυσῶν νομισμάτων, οὐκ ἐπιστρεπτέον, προπληρωτέον."

"Ἓξ ἑβδομάδες; Τεσσαράκοντα χρυσᾶ νομίσματα;"

"Ἐναλλακτικῶς," συνέχισε, φωνὴ λεία ὡς ὁμολογία ἐξελθοῦσα ὑπὸ βίᾳ, "δύναιο ὠνήσασθαι τὸν νέον ἡμῶν τύπον, τὸν Φασματοποιητικὸν τετρακισχιλιοστόν. Χαρακτηρίζεται βελτιωμένῃ φασιστικῇ σταθερότητι, ἠλαττωμένῃ φασματικῇ διαρροῇ, καὶ δωρητικῇ καταρομήσει τὸν πρῶτον μῆνα."

"Βούλει με ὨΝΗΣΑΣΘΑΙ ἈΛΛΟΝ ΔΑΚΤΥΛΙΟΝ;"

"Ὁ Φασματοποιητικὸς τρισχιλιοστὸς κληρονομικὸν προϊόν ἐστιν, ὦ Βάγγινς. Οὐκέτι κατασκευάζομεν ἀντικαταστατικὰ μέρη. Ἔν τινι χρόνῳ, ἡ ἀναβάθμισις γίγνεται πλέον δαπανηεργὸς τῆς ἐπισκευῆς."
** Κεφάλαιον Δ': Ὁ Ἄρχων τῆς Σαυρίου Μορδώρας

"Πρόπεμψόν με," ἐβρύχησα εἰς τὸν ὑποδοχέα. "Πρὸς τὸν ἐπιστάτην σου. Νῦν. Παραχρῆμα."

Σιγή, κύουσα τῷ βάρει χιλίων γραφειοκρατικῶν ἁμαρτημάτων.

"Ὦ Βάγγινε κύριε..."

"Πρόπεμψόν. Με."

Στεναγμὸς διέρρευσεν διὰ τῆς φωνοφόρου γραμμῆς, πνεῦμα φεῦγον ἐκ νεκροῦ τελευταίας ἐκπνοῆς. "Μίαν στιγμὴν παρακαλῶ."

"Οὗτός ἐστι Σαύριος. Ἄρχων, Μορδώρας Ἐργαστήρια."

"Σαύριε. Ὁ Σαύριος; Ὀφθαλμὸς φλογός, χαλκεὺς τῶν..."

"Ναὶ ναὶ ναί, πάντα λίαν κινηματογραφικά, ἡ σημειοποιητικὴ συνομοσπονδία μου ὑπερέβαλεν ἑαυτοὺς ἐκείνῃ τῇ δημοσιονομικῇ ὥρᾳ, μισθοδοτήματα πᾶσιν, οἰνοκρῆναι καὶ τὰ ἑξῆς καὶ τὰ ἑξῆς." Ἡ φωνὴ αὐτοῦ ἐκυλίετο ὡς λίθοι κατὰ ὄρους. "Νῦν δέ. Ὁ δακτύλιός σου. Ὁ Φασματοποιητὴς Γ'. Ἀριθμὸς χαραχθεὶς ἐν πυρὶ Ὄρους Δαίμονος, ψυχθεὶς ἐν αἵματι προδεδομένων χαλκέων. Τί κακοτεχνεῖ;"

"Χθὲς τὰ σκέλη μου τὸν θεῖον οἶνον ἐσκεύαζον, ἐν ᾧ ὁ θώραξ μου τὸν ἀστρικὸν τόπον ἐξηρεύνα. Τῇ πρότερον, ἐπτάρην καὶ ἡ κεφαλή μου ἠφανίσθη, ἀλλὰ τὸ σῶμα ἔμεινεν, βαδίζον εἰς τοίχους ὡς ἀποκεφαλισμένη ὄρνις, προσπίπτον εἰς τὰ ἔπιπλα, φοβερὸν τοῖς γείτοσιν." Ἐψέλλισα.

"Μμμ." Βρόντημα, ἡφαιστειῶδες, ἠπειρωτικὴ πλάξ βουλευομένη εἰ σχίσει. "Κλασσικὴ φθορὰ τῆς στερεογραφῆς. Οἱ δαίμονες οἱ κινοῦντες τὸν κεντρικὸν λογιστὴν τοῦ δακτυλίου σου, μικροὶ βάσταρδοι εἰσίν, ῥᾳθυμοῦσιν. Συμβαίνει. Ἡ περίπτωσίς σου οὐκ ἔστιν ἰδία. Ἔχομεν πελάτας οἵτινες ἀφανίζονται τρισσῶς. Πελάτας οἵτινες ἐγείρονται ἄνω κάτω, ἢ ἔσω ἔξω, ἢ μόνον πλατεῖς ὡς πλακοῦντες. Δυστυχὲς ἀλλὰ ἀναπόφευκτον."

"Ἀναπόφευκτον;" Ἐβόησα, τῆς Σαμυίου κύλικος σειομένης κατὰ τῆς πατάνης, τῶν μυκήτων ἐν τῷ κάτω οἰκήματι ἴσως πτησσόντων. "Ἀναπόφευκτον; Χρυσὸν ἀγαθὸν ἔδωκα ὑπὲρ τούτου τοῦ δακτυλίου! Ὁ ἀγοραστής, οἱ ὀδόντες αὐτοῦ, ὑπέσχετο..."

"Οἱ ἀγορασταὶ πολλὰ ὑπισχνοῦνται, ὦ Βάγγινε κύριε." Ἡ φωνὴ τοῦ Σαυρίου διέρρει διὰ τῆς φωνοφόρου γραμμῆς, μέλι μεμιγμένον ὑελίνῃ κόνει. "Ὑπισχνοῦνται αἰωνιότητα. Ὑπισχνοῦνται τελειότητα. Ὑπισχνοῦνται, ὠνήσασθαι ἅπαξ, ἔχειν μαγείαν ἀεί, ὅπερ, εἰλικρινῶς, ἐν τῇ σῇ περιπτώσει προφανῶς τὸ κύριον πωλητικὸν σημεῖον ἦν, ἦ γάρ;"

"Ἀλλὰ ἐρωτῶ· Πῶς δεῖ με διορθῶσαι αὐτόν, εἰ μὴ δύναμαι ὁρᾶν πῶς ἐργάζεται, εἰ μὴ δύναμαι διαγιγνώσκειν τὸν ἐμαυτοῦ κόσμημα;" Ἐβόησα, τὸν ὑποδοχέα πιέζων οὕτω σφόδρα πρὸς τὸ κρανίον μου ὡς προφανῶς μώλωπα κυκλικὸν ἕξειν αὔριον. "Εἰ τὰ ἔγκατα τούτου τοῦ πράγματος ἀνήκουσι Μορδώρᾳ Ἐργαστηρίοις, τίς κέκτηται αὐτόν; Ἐγώ; Ἢ σύ;"

Ὁ γέλως τοῦ Σαυρίου ἐξέρραγεν, οὐ χαρά, ἀλλὰ νίκη, ψόφος ὑπομιμνῄσκων με στρατευμάτων διαβαινόντων διὰ καιομένων κωμῶν, κοράκων ἑστιωμένων ἐπὶ μαχητικῶν νεκρῶν, νικητηρίων σημείων πεπηγμένων ἐν κρανίοις τῶν νενικημένων. "Κέκτησαι αὐτόν, ὦ Φροδίων Βάγγινε; Ἢ μόνον ἔχεις αὐτόν;"

"Τοῦτο, τοῦτο τὸ αὐτό ἐστιν!"

"Ἠγόρασας τὸν δακτύλιον, ἦ γάρ;" Ἐρράγη ὁ Σαύριος. "Παρανοεῖς τὴν φύσιν τῆς κτήσεως ἐν τῇ νεωτέρᾳ ἡλικίᾳ. Ἠγόρασας τὸν δακτύλιον, ἦ γάρ; Χρυσὸς μετεβλήθη ἐκ χειρῶν, συμβόλαιον ἐσφραγίσθη, τάχα ἐν αἵματι, τάχα ἐν μέλανι, οἱ λογισταὶ οὐ διευκρινίζουσιν. Κέκτησαι τὸ φυσικὸν πρᾶγμα, τὸν μεταλλικὸν δακτύλιον στρεβλοῦντα τὴν διαστατικὴν στάσιν τῶν ἀναξυρίδων σου. Ἐκεῖνός ἐστι σός."

"Μεμισθωμένην," ἐπανέλαβον.

"Ἀλλά!" Ἡ λέξις ἐξέρραγεν διὰ τῆς φωνοφόρου γραμμῆς, θραύσματα συλλαβῶν, ὁ Σάμυιος ἔπτηξεν ὡς ἐπερχομένῃ βολῇ. "Ἡ λογισμογραφία. Τὰ ἀφανισμοῦ πρωτόκολλα. Ἡ δαιμονικὴ ἀρχιτεκτονικὴ ἡ κινοῦσα τὴν σὴν ἀφάνισιν—ἐκεῖνο, ὦ Βάγγινε κύριε, μεμίσθωσαι. Ἀορίστως, ναί, διὰ τοῦ φυσικοῦ σου βίου καὶ μικρῶς ἐπέκεινα, ἀλλὰ μεμίσθωσαι ὅμως. Κέκτησαι τὸν δακτύλιον. Ἡμεῖς κεκτήμεθα τὴν μαγείαν ἐν αὐτῷ."

"Καὶ ταῦτα τὰ ἀναγραφεῖα, ἡ διαγνωστικὴ κατάρρησις, τὸ θαυματουργικὸν ἴχνος σωροῦ; Σύ, Φροδίων Βάγγινε, πολίτης χόββιτος, θέλεις ἀποβλέψαι εἰς τὰ ἔγκατα ἰδιόκτητης τεχνολογίας χιλιετηρίδας ἐπινοηθείσης; Τεχνολογίας ἥτις ἐκόστισε μυριάδας ἐν ἐρεύνῃ, ἐν θυσίᾳ κυριολεκτικῇ, ἐν αἵματι ἐκχυθέντι μετρηθέντι κατὰ τὸν ὠκεανόν;"

"Ὁ δακτύλιος μένει σός, ὦ Βάγγινε κύριε. Ἡ ἀφάνισις, ὅμως, ἐκείνην μόνον δανείζομεν. Ἀορίστως, ναί, ἀιδίως ἐνίοτε, ἀλλὰ δανείζομεν. Ἔχεις μίσθωσιν. Ἀμετάκλητον, οὐ μεταβιβαστήν, δεσμευτικὴν μέχρι θανάτου καὶ ἔτι πλέον.

Καταλειφθήσῃ μετὰ κύκλου μετάλλου λίαν πολυτελοῦς, λίαν ἀχρήστου."

"Ἆρα τοῦτο νόμιμόν ἐστιν;"

"Τελείως νόμιμον," ἔφριξεν ὁ Σαύριος, αἴλουρος ἱκανοποιηθεὶς μετὰ καναρίου κατάπωσιν. "Ῥῆτρα ἑπτακαιδεκάτη, ὑποδιαίρεσις Β', παράγραφος ἐνάτη. 'Ὁ χρήστης ὁμολογεῖ ὅτι ἡ ἀφανιστικὴ λειτουργικότης συνιστᾷ μεμισθωμένην νοητικὴν ἰδιοκτησίαν καὶ μένει ἰδιοκτησία μόνη Μορδώρας Ἐργαστηρίων εἰς αἰῶνα συν ἑβδομήκοντα ἔτεσιν, ὁπότερον ἔσχατον ἔλθῃ.' Τοῦτο ἐσφράγισας, ὦ Βάγγινε κύριε. Ἡ ὑπογραφή σου κεῖται ἐν τῷ ἡμετέρῳ θησαυροφυλακίῳ, τετηρημένη ἐν ἠλέκτρῳ, φυλασσομένη ὑπὸ Βαλρώγων."

"Ἐὰν παραβῇς τοὺς ὅρους τῆς ὑπηρεσίας, ἀντιμηχανολογῇς τὰς ἐπῳδάς, μεταδιδῷς τὰς γοητείας, πειρᾶσαι θραῦσαι τὴν κατάραν, τιθῇς τὸν πηγαῖον κώδικα ἐν δημοσίοις φόροις ἄλλοις δυσαρέστοις, τηροῦμεν τὸ δικαίωμα, ὦ Βάγγινε κύριε, ἀπομάκροθεν ἀπενεργοποιῆσαι τὰ μεμισθωμένα σου χαρακτηριστικά."

"Δύνασθε κλεῖσαι αὐτόν;"

"Μετὰ νοήματος. Μετὰ ὑπομνήματος.

"Ἔχομεν συνέσιν, ὦ Βάγγινε κύριε;"

Ἐνεῦσα, συνεῖδον ὅτι οὐκ ἐδύνατο ὁρᾶν, ἔκραξα, "Ναί."

"Θαυμάσιον. Εὐχαριστῶ ὅτι ἐξέλεξας Μορδώρας Ἐργαστήρια, ἔνθα τὸ σκότος σου ἐστὶν ἡ ἡμετέρα ἐργασία. Ἔχε ἡμέραν."

Κλικ.

Ἡ γραμμὴ ἀπέθανεν.

"Φροδίων," εἶπεν ἠρέμα ὁ Σάμυιος, "νομίζω δεῖ σε πλείονος μυκητικοῦ οἴνου."

Ἐνεῦσα. Οἱ λόγοι ἐγκατέλειψάν με. Ὁ λογισμὸς ἔφυγεν κεκραγώς.

Ἐν πύργῳ μέλανος λίθου καὶ διαδοσιοφύλλων, ὁ Σαύριος ἐπανῆλθεν εἰς τὴν χαρτουργίαν, ἄλλη ψυχὴ δεδεμένη οὐ κατάραις ἀλλὰ συμβολαίοις, πολὺ πλέον ἀιδίοις, πολὺ πλέον ὠμοῖς.

Ὁ ὑποδοχεὺς ἐκάθισεν βαρὺς ἐν τῇ χειρί μου. Διὰ τῆς θυρίδος, κόραξ κατέπτη, ἔκλινε τὴν κεφαλήν, κρίνων με ὀφθαλμοῖς οἵτινες ἑώρακον ταύτην τὴν συνομιλίαν διαδραματισθεῖσαν χιλιάκις πρότερον, ἐν χιλίαις διαφόροις οἰκίαις, μετὰ χιλίων διαφόρων ἠπατημένων κρατούντων τηλεφωνοφόρους καὶ συνιδόντων ὀψέ τι ὅτι ἐπράθησαν ἔλαιον ὄφεων ὑπὸ ἀνδρὸς μετὰ ὡραίων ὀδόντων. Οὕτως ὡραίων ὀδόντων!
** Κεφάλαιον Δ': Ὁ Ἀρχηγὸς τῆς Σαυρίου Μορδώρας

"Πρόσαγε με," ἐβρύχησα εἰς τὸν δεκτῆρα. "Πρὸς τὸν ἐπιστάτην σου. Νῦν. Παραχρῆμα."

Σιγή, βαρεῖα τῷ βάρει χιλίων γραφειοκρατικῶν ἁμαρτημάτων.

"Κύριε Βακκίδη..."

"Πρόσαγε. Με."

Στεναγμὸς διέρρευσεν διὰ τῆς τηλεφωνικῆς γραμμῆς, ὥσπερ πνεῦμα ἐκ τῆς ἐσχάτης συστολῆς νεκροῦ. "Στιγμὴν μίαν, παρακαλῶ."

"Σαύριός εἰμι. Ἀρχηγός, τῶν Μορδώρας Ἐργαστηρίων."

"Σαύριε. Ὁ Σαύριος; Ὀφθαλμὸς πυρός, χαλκεὺς τῶν..."

"Ναὶ ναὶ ναί, πάντα μάλα θεατρικά, ἡ τῆς σημάνσεως ἐμὴ ὁμὰς ἑαυτὴν ὑπερέβη ἐκείνῃ τῇ οἰκονομικῇ περιόδῳ, δῶρα πᾶσιν, κρῆναι οἴνου καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ καὶ τὰ λοιπά." Ἡ φωνὴ αὐτοῦ ἐκυλίετο ὡς λίθοι κατ' ὄρους. "Νῦν δέ. Ὁ δακτύλιός σου. Ὁ Φαντασιοποιὸς Τρισχίλιος. Ὁ ἀριθμὸς σειρᾶς ἐγκεχαραγμένος ἐν πυρὶ Δόμου Ὄλεθρου, ψυχθεὶς ἐν αἵματι προδοθέντων χαλκέων. Τί δυσλειτουργεῖ;"

"Χθὲς τὰ σκέλη μου ἐποίησε τὸ τῆς βοτάνης πόμα ἐνῷ ὁ θώραξ ἠρεύνα τὸ ἀστρικὸν πεδίον. Τῇ προτεραίᾳ, ἔπταρον καὶ ἡ κεφαλὴ ἠφανίσθη ἀλλὰ τὸ σῶμα ἔμεινεν, ἐμβαδίζον εἰς τοίχους ὥσπερ ἀποκεφαλισθεῖσα ὄρνις, προσκρούον εἰς τὰ ἔπιπλα, φοβεροποιοῦν τοὺς γείτονας." Ἐψελλισάμην.

"Μμμ." Βρόμος, ἡφαιστειώδης, χθονικὴ πλὰξ κρίνουσα πότερον σχισθῇ. "Κλασικὴ φθορὰ τοῦ βεβαιώματος.

Πελάτας οἳ ἐγείρονται ἄνω κάτω, ἢ ἔσω ἔξω, ἢ ἁπλῶς πλατεῖς ὡς πλακοῦντες. Δυστυχὲς ἀλλὰ ἀναπόφευκτον."

"Ἀναπόφευκτον;" Ἐβόησα, τῆς Σαμυΐου τρυβλίου κροτουμένου κατὰ τὸ πινάκιον, τῶν μυκήτων ἐν τῷ ὑπογείῳ κάτω ἴσως συσπειρουμένων. "Ἀναπόφευκτον; Χρυσὸν ἀγαθὸν ἐτέλεσα ὑπὲρ τούτου τοῦ δακτυλίου! Ὁ πωλητής, οἱ ὀδόντες ἐκεῖνοι αὐτοῦ, ὑπέσχετο..."

"Οἱ πωληταὶ πολλὰ ὑπισχνοῦνται, κύριε Βακκίδη." Ἡ φωνὴ τοῦ Σαυρίου διέρρει διὰ τῆς τηλεφωνικῆς γραμμῆς, μέλι μεμιγμένον μετὰ ὑάλου κεκομμένης. "Ὑπισχνοῦνται αἰωνιότητα. Ὑπισχνοῦνται τελειότητα. Ὑπισχνοῦνται, ἀγόρασον ἅπαξ, ἔχε μαγείαν ἀεί, ὅπερ, εἴπωμεν τὴν ἀλήθειαν, ἐν τῇ σῇ περιπτώσει ἴσως ἦν τὸ κύριον σημεῖον πωλήσεως, οὐχί;"

"Ἀλλὰ ἐρωτῶ· Πῶς με δεῖ ἐπισκευάσαι αὐτόν, εἰ μὴ δύναμαι ὁρᾶν πῶς ἐργάζεται, εἰ μὴ δύναμαι διαγιγνώσκειν τὸ ἐμὸν κόσμημα." Ἐβόησα, τὸν δεκτῆρα οὕτω σφόδρα πρὸς τὸ κρανίον πιέζων ὥστε ἴσως μώλωπα κυκλοτερῆ αὔριον ἕξω. "Εἰ τὰ ἔγκατα τούτου τοῦ πράγματος ἀνήκουσι τοῖς Μορδώρας Ἐργαστηρίοις, τότε τίς κύριός ἐστιν αὐτοῦ; Ἐγώ; Ἢ σύ;"

Ὁ γέλως τοῦ Σαυρίου ἐξερράγη, οὐχὶ χαρὰ ἀλλὰ νίκη, ἦχος ὑπομιμνῄσκων με στρατευμάτων διαβαινόντων διὰ καιομένων κωμῶν, κοράκων ἑστιωμένων ἐπὶ μαχητικῶν νεκρῶν, σημαιῶν νίκης πεφυτευμένων ἐν τοῖς κρανίοις τῶν νενικημένων. "Κύριός εἶ αὐτοῦ, Φροδίων Βακκίδη; Ἢ μόνον κέκτησαι αὐτόν;"

"Τοῦτό ἐστι, τοῦτό ἐστι τὸ αὐτό!"

"Ἠγόρασας τὸν δακτύλιον, ναί;" Ὁ Σαύριος ἐσπάραξεν, "Οὐ συνίεις τὴν φύσιν τῆς κυριότητος ἐν τῇ νεωτέρᾳ ἐποχῇ. Ἠγόρασας τὸν δακτύλιον, ναί; Χρυσὸς μετεδόθη, συμβόλαιον ὑπεγράφη, ἴσως ἐν αἵματι, ἴσως ἐν μέλανι, οἱ λογισταὶ οὐ προσδιορίζουσιν. Κύριός εἶ τοῦ φυσικοῦ ἀντικειμένου, τῆς μεταλλικῆς περιόχου στρεβλούσης τὴν διαστατικὴν εὐστάθειαν τῶν ἀναξυρίδων σου. Τοῦτό ἐστι σόν."

"Μεμίσθωται," ἐπανέλαβον.

"Ἀλλά!" Ἡ λέξις ἐξεπυρσοκροτήθη διὰ τῆς τηλεφωνικῆς γραμμῆς, θραύσματα συλλαβῶν, ὁ Σαμύιος ἐκύπτησεν ὡς ὑπὸ ἐπερχομένῳ πυροβολικῷ. "Τὸ λογισμικόν! Τὰ τῆς ἀφανίσεως πρωτόκολλα!

Κύριός εἶ τοῦ δακτυλίου. Ἡμεῖς κύριοί ἐσμεν τῆς μαγείας ἔνδον αὐτοῦ."

"Καὶ αὗται αἱ καταγραφαί, ἡ διαγνωστικὴ κατάρρακτις, τὸ θαυματουργικὸν ἴχνος στοίβας; Σύ, Φροδίων Βακκίδη, πολίτης χόββιτος, θέλεις προσβλέπειν εἰς τὰ ἔγκατα ἰδιοκτησίου τεχνολογίας χιλιετηρίδας ἐξελιχθείσης; Τεχνολογίας ἥτις ἐκόστισε δισεκατομμύρια ἐν ἐρεύνᾳ, ἐν θυσίᾳ λεκτικῇ, ἐν αἵματι ἐκχυθέντι μετρηθέντι ὑπὸ τοῦ ὠκεανοῦ;"

"Ὁ δακτύλιος μένει σός, κύριε Βακκίδη. Ἡ ἀφάνισις ὅμως, ταύτην μόνον δανείζομεν. Ἀορίστως, ναί, διηνεκῶς ἀκόμη, ἀλλὰ δανείζομεν. Ἔχεις ἄδειαν.

"Ἆρα νόμιμόν ἐστι τοῦτο;"

"Τελείως νόμιμον," ὁ Σαύριος ἔγρυξεν, αἴλουρος εὐαρεστημένος μετὰ καναρίου κατάποσιν. "Ῥῆτρα ἑπτακαιδεκάτη, ὑποδιαίρεσις Β, παράγραφος ἐνάτη.

"Φροδίων," εἶπεν ἡσύχως ὁ Σαμύιος, "νομίζω ὅτι δέῃ σε πλείονος μυκητικοῦ πόματος."

Ἔνευσα. Οἱ λόγοι με ἐγκατελελοίπεσαν. Ὁ λογισμὸς ἔφυγε βοῶν.

Ἐν πύργῳ μέλανος λίθου καὶ λογιστικῶν φύλλων, ὁ Σαύριος ἐπέστρεψεν εἰς τὴν χαρτουργίαν αὐτοῦ, ἄλλη ψυχὴ δεδεμένη οὐχὶ κατάραις ἀλλὰ συμβολαίοις, πολλῷ μονιμωτέροις, πολλῷ ὠμοτέροις.

Ὁ δεκτὴρ ἐκάθητο βαρὺς ἐν τῇ χειρί μου. Διὰ τῆς θυρίδος, κόραξ κατέβη, ἔκλινε τὴν κεφαλήν, κρίνων με μετὰ ὀφθαλμῶν οἳ ἑωράκεσαν τὸν διάλογον τοῦτον ἀναπαιζόμενον χιλιάκις πρότερον, ἐν χιλίαις ἑτέραις οἰκίαις, μετὰ χιλίων ἑτέρων ἠλιθίων κατεχόντων τηλεφώνους καὶ ἀναγιγνωσκόντων ὀψὲ ὅτι ἐπέπραντο ἔλαιον ὄφεως ὑπὸ ἀνδρὸς μετὰ καλῶν ὀδόντων. Οὕτω καλῶν ὀδόντων!

** Κεφάλαιον Ε': Γάνδαλφος καὶ ὁ ἵππος αὐτοῦ

Ἡ θυρίς, ῥυπαρὰ οὖσα, ἐδήλου μοι κίνησιν, καὶ ψόφος ὁπλῶν ἐπὶ χαλίκων ἀνήγγειλε προσιόντα τινά.

Ἵππος, λευκός, μονόφθαλμος, προσέδραμε κατὰ τὴν ὁδόν, ὥσπερ θανάτου γαμήλιον ἅρμα, πᾶς ὀστέον καὶ μῦς καὶ συνταξία, αἱ ὁπλαὶ αὐτοῦ κρούουσαι πρὸς τὸν λίθον, κλόπ θούδ κλόπ, ῥυθμὸς ἀνώμαλος, τὸ θηρίον εὐλαβούμενον τὴν ἀριστερὰν πρόσθιον σκέλος. Ὀφθαλμὸν ἕνα εἶχεν, τοῦ ἀριστεροῦ κόγχου κενοῦ ὄντος, συμπεπτωκότος εἴσω, κρατῆρός τινος. Ὁ λοιπὸς ὀφθαλμὸς ἐστρέφετο, μέγας ὡς ᾠὸν ἡψημένον, ἐπισκοπῶν τὸν κόσμον.

Γάνδαλφος ἐφ' αὐτῷ ἐκάθητο, ὁ πώγων αὐτοῦ καταρρέων, ὁ καταρράκτης τῆς κόμης αὐτοῦ ἄγριος γεγονὼς καὶ λευκὸς ὡς ὕδωρ πλυνοῦ, αἱ στολαὶ αὐτοῦ ῥιπιζόμεναι.

"Σαμύιε," ἔσυρισα, "Γάνδαλφος ἔξω ἐστίν."

"Γάνδαλφος;" Ἡ κεφαλὴ Σαμυίου ἐστράφη ὀξέως, τὸ τσάϊον αὐτοῦ κυμαινόμενον. "Ὁ μάγος Γάνδαλφος; Ἐνθάδε; Νῦν;"

Ἐξεπέσομεν ἔξω, ὁ ἵππος ἔστη. Ἐπνέει βαρέως, οἱ μυκτῆρες αὐτοῦ διαστελλόμενοι, ἡ πνοὴ αὐτοῦ ἀτμίζουσα ἐν τῷ ἀέρι, ὃς οὐκ ἔδει ψυχρὸς εἶναι ἀλλ' ἦν ὅμως.

Κατέβη, ὁ ἵππος ἐφρύαξεν, ὁ μόνος ἐκεῖνος ὀφθαλμὸς στρεφόμενος.

"Τί τὸ πρόβλημα δοκεῖ εἶναι, Φροδίων;" Γάνδαλφος προσῆλθεν.

"Ὁ δακτύλιός μου," ἠρξάμην. "Ἠγόρασα αὐτὸν ἀπὸ τῆς Καπηλείας τοῦ Ἀδελφιδοῦ Βίλβωνος, παρὰ τὸ τμῆμα τῶν ἐλφικῶν κτενῶν, οἶσθα τὸν τόπον; Πωλοῦσι δακτυλίους ἀοράτου ποιήσεως, νομίμους..."

"Νομίμους," ἐφρύαξεν Γάνδαλφος, ὁ ψόφος ὥσπερ φρύαγμα ἵππου, καταφρονητικός, ἀρχαῖος.

"...μετὰ γραμμάτων προειδοποιητικῶν! Ἐπαγγελματικῶν γραμμάτων προειδοποιητικῶν! 'Χρῶ τῷδε τῷ δακτυλίῳ μόνον εἰ μὴ σέβῃ χρόνον, χῶρον.'"

"Καὶ δή;" Γάνδαλφος ἐπερείσατο τῇ βακτηρίᾳ αὐτοῦ, τὸ βάρος μετατιθείς, ἀναμένων.

"Καὶ κακῶς λειτουργεῖ! Χθὲς τὰ σκέλη μου ἐβάδιζε χωρὶς τοῦ θώρακός μου. Σήμερον; Σήμερον, Γάνδαλφε, ἔμυσα καὶ ὁ ἀριστερὸς βραχίων μου ἠφανίσθη ἐπὶ ἓξ λεπτά. Ἕξ! Οἶσθα πόσον χαλεπόν ἐστιν ἄλειψιν ἄρτου βουτύρῳ χειρὶ μιᾷ ὅταν ὁ ἀπολωλὼς βραχίων ᾖ ὁ κυριώτερος;"

Ὁ πώγων Γανδάλφου ἔσπασεν, ἴσως μειδίαμα ἦν, ἴσως δυσχέρεια. "Ἐτηλεφώνησας τῷ τεχνίτῃ."

Οὐκ ἐρώτησις. Ἀπόφανσις. ἬΙδει.

"Μορδόρᾳ Βιομηχανίαις. Διελέχθην αὐτῷ Σαύρῳ. Ἐκεῖνος ἐδήλωσέ μοι..." Ἔπτυσα τοὺς λόγους, ἰῷ μεμιγμένους, χόλῳ βεβαμμένους, "...ὅτι κέκτημαι τὸν δακτύλιον ἀλλὰ μισθοῦμαι τὴν ἀοράτου ποίησιν. Ὅτι ἡ μαγεία ἔνδον ἀνήκει αὐτοῖς. Εἰς ἀεί. Διηνεκῶς. Ὅτι δύνανται ἀποκινεῖν αὐτὴν τηλόθεν ἐὰν παραβαίνω τοὺς ὅρους ὑπηρεσίας οὓς οὐκ ἀνέγνων διότι τίς ἀναγιγνώσκει ὅρους ὑπηρεσίας;"

"Πάντας δεῖ," Γάνδαλφος ἐψιθύρισεν, "ἀλλ' οὐδεὶς ποιεῖ. Μῦθος παλαιὸς ὡς χρόνος, ἐκεῖνος."

Σαμύιος ἐφθέγξατο, φωνῇ μυὸς τρίζοντος, "Ἔξω ἑαυτοῦ ἐστιν, Γάνδαλφε. Κυρίως λελυμένος. Πίνει τὸ μυκητικόν μου τσάϊον καὶ σπειροῦται περὶ κτήσεως ἐναντίον κατοχῆς καὶ..."

"Τί δὲ σύ, Γάνδαλφε;" ἠρώτησα, "Διὰ τί ἐλαύνεις τοῦτο τὸ κυκλωπικὸν βδέλυγμα ἀντὶ ὀχήματός τινος εὐλόγου;"

Ὁ ἵππος πάλιν ἐφρύαξεν, ἴσως προσβληθείς, ὁ μόνος ἐκεῖνος ὀφθαλμὸς συσταλλόμενος.

"Ἀνακαίνισις," Γάνδαλφος ἐβρύχησεν, ὁ λόγος ἀποδακνόμενος ὀξέως. "Λογισμάτων ἀνακαίνισις. Αὐτοκίνητος λογισμάτων ἀνακαίνισις κατεστήσατο ἑαυτὴν διὰ τῆς νυκτὸς ὅτε τὸ ὄχημά μου ἐκάθητο φορτιζόμενον. Μεσονύκτιον. Οὐδεμία προειδοποίησις. Οὐδεμία συγκατάθεσις. Μόνον πινγκ, 'Ἀνακαίνισις ἑτοίμη, καθισταμένη νῦν, μὴ ἀποσυνδέσῃς δύναμιν, τοῦτο λήψεται πεντεκαίδεκα λεπτά.'"

"Πεντεκαίδεκα λεπτά;" Σαμύιος ἤρετο.

"Ἑπτακαίδεκα ὥρας," Γάνδαλφος ἐβρόντησεν, ἡ βακτηρία παίουσα γῆν, σπινθῆρες πετόμενοι, σπινθῆρες ἀληθινοί, μικρὰ πυρὰ ταχέως ἀποθνῄσκοντα. "Ἑπτακαίδεκα ὧραι τοῦ 'Βελτιοῦμεν συστηματικὴν ἐνέργειαν, παρακαλῶ ἀναμεῖνον.' Ἦλθεν ἕως. Ἀνέτειλεν ἥλιος, ὄρνιθες ᾖσαν τὰς μωρὰς αὐτῶν ᾠδάς. Ὄχημα ἔτι βελτιοῦν. Ἔτι ἀναμένον. Ἐσκεψάμην τὰ φόρα..."

"Φόρα;" Ἔμυσα.

"Μαγικὰ φόρα. Τεχνικὴν βοήθειαν τοῖς μαγικῶς ἐνδιαφερομένοις. Φαίνεται αὕτη ἡ ἀνακαίνισις, ἔκδοσις 7.4.2, πλινθοποιεῖ ὀχήματα κατασκευασθέντα πρὸ τοῦ Ἔτους τῆς Ἐστραμμένης Σελήνης. Πλινθοποιεῖ αὐτά. Ἀκινητοποιεῖ αὐτὰ τελείως. Οὐκ ἄρχεται. Οὐ φορτίζεται. Μόνον κάθηται ἐκεῖ, κόσμημα προαυλείου."

"Ὥστε ἐλαύνεις..." Ἐνεῦσα πρὸς τὸν ἵππον.

"Μάγνος," Γάνδαλφος εἶπεν. "Τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐστι Μάγνος. Μονόφθαλμος λευκὸς ἵππος. Ἐδεόμην μεταφορᾶς, ἐκεῖνος ἐδεῖτο σκοποῦ."

Μάγνος ἐπάταξε ὁπλήν, ὁ μόνος ὀφθαλμὸς στηριζόμενος ἐπ' ἐμέ, ἡ κόρη αὐτοῦ διασταλλομένη, συσταλλομένη, ἀνησυχητικῷ ὑπνωτικῷ ῥυθμῷ.

"Πόσον χρόνον ἕως τὸ ὄχημά σου ἰαθῇ;" Σαμύιος ἐτόλμησεν.

"Ἡ τεχνικὴ βοήθεια λέγει ἐπιδιόρθωσιν ἐρχομένην τὴν ἑπομένην ἑβδομάδα. Ἴσως. Δυνατῶς. 'Ταχέως.' Οἶσθα πῶς ταῦτα βαίνει. Μεταξύ, ἐλαύνω Μάγνον. Συνδεόμεθα. Ἀνέχεταί με. Νῦν. Περὶ τοῦ δακτυλίου σου. Δεῖξόν μοι αὐτόν."

Ἐξέσπασα τὸν δακτύλιον ἐκ κόλπου, ἐξέτεινα αὐτόν, ὁ χαλκὸς λαβὼν φῶς κακῶς, κάμπτων αὐτό, διαστρέφων αὐτό, ἡ ὑπαρκτικὴ κυμαινομένη περὶ τὴν περιφέρειαν.

Γάνδαλφος ἔλαβεν αὐτόν, κατέσχεν αὐτὸν ἐγγύς, ὀφθαλμῷ διακρίνων, ἑτέρῳ ὀφθαλμῷ διαφόρως διακρίνων, ἐξετάζων, ἐρευνῶν, ψιθυρίζων λόγους οὓς οὐκ ἐγνώριζον, ἴσως οὐκ ἔδει γνωρίζειν.

"Μμμ," τέλος εἶπεν. "Ναί. Πάντως φαῦλος. Πάντως κατηραμένος. Πάντως παραβαίνων ἑπτακοσίους περίπου κανόνας περὶ διαστατικῆς χειρισμοῦ. Εὐτυχὴς εἶ ὅτι οὔπω ἐφάσισας διὰ τοῦ πλανητικοῦ πυρῆνος."

"Δύνασαι ἰάσασθαι αὐτόν;"

Ἔρριψε τὸν δακτύλιον πάλιν. Ἔλαβον αὐτόν, ἐψηλάφησα, μικροῦ κατέβαλον αὐτόν.

"Οὔ, Φροδίων. Οὐ δύναμαι ἰάσασθαι αὐτόν. Οὐδεὶς δύναται ἰάσασθαι αὐτὸν ἄνευ τοῦ ἴχνους ἐκτελέσεως, διότι ἡ ἴασις κοστίζει μόνον τὰ μέρη ἀντικαταστάσεως καὶ τὸ πωλεῖν σοι νέον πρότυπον ποιεῖ πλείονα χρήματα. Ἁπλῆ οἰκονομία. Παλαιὰ ὡς δράκοντες θησαυρίζοντες χρυσόν. Παλαιοτέρα."

Μάγνος ἐχρεμέτισεν, ἴσως συμφωνῶν, ἢ πεινῶν. Χαλεπὸν εἰπεῖν μετὰ μονοφθάλμων ἵππων.

Σαμύιος ἐψιθύρισέ τι περὶ "οὐ τοῦτο πάλιν" καὶ ἀνεχώρησεν εἰς τὸν κατώγειον.
** Κεφάλαιον Ε': Γάνδαλφος καὶ ὁ ἵππος αὐτοῦ

Ἡ θυρίς, ῥυπαρὰ οὖσα, κίνησίν μοι ἔδειξε, καὶ ὁ κτύπος ὁπλῶν ἐπὶ χαλίκων ἀνήγγειλέ τινα προσιόντα.

Ἵππος, λευκός, μονόφθαλμος, ἦλθε τρέχων κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν ὥσπερ ἅρμα γάμου Θανάτου, πᾶς ὀστέον μῦς συντονία, αἱ ὁπλαὶ αὐτοῦ κτυποῦσαι πρὸς λίθον, κλοπ θουδ κλοπ, ῥυθμὸς ἀνώμαλος, τὸ θηρίον χωλαῖνον τῇ ἀριστερᾷ προσθίᾳ σκελίδι. Ἕνα ὀφθαλμὸν εἶχεν, ὁ ἀριστερὸς κόγχη κενή, συμπεπτωκυῖα εἴσω, κρατήρ τις. Ὁ λοιπὸς ὀφθαλμὸς ἐκυλίετο, μέγας ὡς ᾠὸν ἡψημένον, σκοπῶν τὸν κόσμον.

Γάνδαλφος ἐφ' αὐτῷ ἐκάθητο, ὁ πώγων αὐτοῦ καταρρέων, ὁ καταρράκτης τῆς κόμης αὐτοῦ ἄγριος καὶ λευκὸς ὡς ὕδωρ πλυντρίου, αἱ στολαὶ αὐτοῦ ῥιπιζόμεναι.

"Σαμύιε," ἔσυρισα, "Γάνδαλφος ἔξω ἐστί."

"Γάνδαλφος;" Ἡ κεφαλὴ Σαμυίου μετεστράφη ὀξέως, τὸ θείον αὐτοῦ χεόμενον. "Ὁ μάγος Γάνδαλφος; Ἐνθάδε; Νῦν;"

Ἐξεπροπατήσαμεν ἔξω, ὁ ἵππος ἔστη. Ἔπνει βαρέως, αἱ μυκτῆρες αὐτοῦ διαστελλόμεναι, ἡ πνοὴ αὐτοῦ ἀτμίζουσα ἐν τῷ ἀέρι, ὃς οὐκ ἔδει ψυχρὸς εἶναι ἀλλ' ὅμως ἦν.

Κατέβη, ὁ ἵππος ἐφρύαξεν, ὁ μόνος ἐκεῖνος ὀφθαλμὸς κυλιόμενος.

"Τί δοκεῖ τὸ πρόβλημα εἶναι, Φροδίων;" Γάνδαλφος προσῆλθεν.

"Ὁ δακτύλιός μου," ἠρξάμην. "Ἠγόρασα αὐτὸν ἐκ τῆς Βιλβῶνος Ἀδελφιδοῦ Ἐργαστηρίου, παρὰ τὸ τῶν ἐλφικῶν κτενῶν τμῆμα, οἶσθα τὸν τόπον; Πωλοῦσι δακτυλίους ἀοράτου ποιήσεως, νομίμους..."

"Νομίμους," Γάνδαλφος ἐφρύαξε, ὁ ἦχος ὥσπερ φρύαγμα ἵππου, καταφρονητικός, ἀρχαῖος.

"...μετὰ προειδοποιητικῶν πινακίδων! Ἐπαγγελματικῶν προειδοποιητικῶν πινακίδων! 'Χρῶ τῷδε τῷ δακτυλίῳ μόνον εἰ μὴ σέβῃ χρόνον, χῶρον.'"

"Καί;" Γάνδαλφος ἐπερείσατο τῇ βακτηρίᾳ, τὸ βάρος μετατιθείς, μένων.

"Καὶ κακῶς λειτουργεῖ! Χθὲς τὰ σκέλη μου ἐβάδισε χωρὶς τοῦ θώρακός μου. Σήμερον πρωΐ; Σήμερον πρωΐ, Γάνδαλφε, ἐπεκάρην καὶ ὁ ἀριστερὸς βραχίων μου ἠφανίσθη ἐπὶ ἓξ λεπτὰ τῆς ὥρας. Ἕξ! Οἶσθα πῶς χαλεπόν ἐστι βουτυροῦν ἄρτον μονοχείρως ὅταν ὁ ἀπολωλὼς βραχίων ὁ κύριός ἐστιν;"

Ὁ πώγων Γανδάλφου ἐσπάσθη, τάχα μειδίαμα, τάχα ἀηδία. "Ἐτηλεφώνησας τῷ τεχνίτῃ."

Οὐκ ἐρώτημα. Φάσις. Ἠπίστατο.

"Μορδόρα Βιομηχανίαις. Διελέχθην Σαύριῳ αὐτῷ. Ἐκεῖνος ἐμήνυσέ μοι..." Ἐξέπτυσα τοὺς λόγους, ἰῷ μεμιγμένους, θυμῷ βεβρεγμένους, "...ὅτι κέκτημαι τὸν δακτύλιον ἀλλὰ μισθοῦμαι τὴν ἀοράτου ποίησιν. Ὅτι ἡ μαγεία ἔνδον ἐκείνων ἐστίν. Εἰς αἰῶνα. Διηνεκῶς. Ὅτι δύνανται ἀποκινεῖν αὐτὴν τηλόθεν ἐὰν παραβαίνω ὅρους ὑπηρεσίας οὓς οὐκ ἀνέγνων διότι τίς ἀναγιγνώσκει ὅρους ὑπηρεσίας;"

"Πάντες δέον," Γάνδαλφος ἐψιθύρισεν, "ἀλλ' οὐδεὶς ποιεῖ. Μῦθος παλαιὸς ὡς χρόνος, ἐκεῖνος."

Σαμύιος ἀνεφθέγξατο, φωνῇ μυὸς τρίζοντος, "Ἔξω ἑαυτοῦ ἐστι, Γάνδαλφε. Κυρίως διαλελυμένος. Πέπωκε τὸ μυκητῶδες θεῖόν μου καὶ ἑλίσσεται περὶ κτήσεως πρὸς κατοχὴν καὶ..."

"Πῶς δὲ σύ, Γάνδαλφε;" ἠρόμην, "Διὰ τί ἱππεύεις τόδε τὸ κυκλώπειον μίασμα ἀντὶ τοῦ ἐλαύνειν τι σώφρον;"

Ὁ ἵππος πάλιν ἐφρύαξεν, ὑβρισμένος ἴσως, ὁ μόνος ἐκεῖνος ὀφθαλμὸς στενούμενος.

"Ἀναγραφή," Γάνδαλφος ἐβρόντησε, λόγος ἀποδεδηγμένος ὀξέως. "Τεχνογραφικὴ ἀναγραφή. Αὐτοκίνητος τεχνογραφικὴ ἀναγραφὴ αὑτὴν κατέστησε διὰ τῆς νυκτὸς ἐνῷ τὸ ὄχημά μου ἐκάθητο φορτιζόμενον. Μεσονύκτιον. Οὐδεμία προειδοποίησις. Οὐδεμία συγκατάθεσις. Μόνον πινγ, 'Ἀναγραφὴ διαθέσιμος, καθιστᾶσα νῦν, μὴ ἀποσυνδέσῃς δύναμιν, τοῦτο δεκαπέντε λεπτὰ λήψεται.'"

"Δεκαπέντε λεπτά;" Σαμύιος ἤρετο.

"Ἑπτακαίδεκα ὧραι," Γάνδαλφος ἐβόησε, βακτηρίᾳ παίσας γῆν, σπινθῆρες πετόμενοι, ὄντως σπινθῆρες, πυρίδια μικρὰ ταχέως θνῄσκοντα. "Ἑπτακαίδεκα ὧραι 'Βελτιοῦντες συστηματικὴν ἐνέργειαν, ἀναμένετε.' Ἦλθεν ἕως. Ἀνέτειλεν ἥλιος, ὄρνιθες ᾖσαν τὰ μωρὰ ᾄσματα αὐτῶν. Ὄχημα ἔτι βελτιοῦν. Ἔτι μένον. Ἐσκεψάμην τὰ συνέδρια..."

"Συνέδρια;" Ἐπέκαρον.

"Μαγικὰ συνέδρια. Τεχνικὴ ὑποστήριξις τοῖς μαγικῶς κεκλιμένοις. Φαίνεται αὕτη ἡ ἀναγραφή, ἔκδοσις 7.4.2, πλινθοποιεῖ ὀχήματα τετευχότα πρὸ τοῦ Ἔτους τῆς Ἐστραμμένης Σελήνης. Πλινθοποιεῖ αὐτά. Ἀκινητοποιεῖ αὐτὰ τελέως. Οὐκ ἄρχεται. Οὐ φορτίζεται. Μόνον κάθηται ἐκεῖ, κόσμημα εἰσόδου."

"Οὕτως ἱππεύεις..." Ἐνεῦσα πρὸς τὸν ἵππον.

"Μάγνος," Γάνδαλφος εἶπε. "Τοὔνομα αὐτῷ Μάγνος ἐστί. Μονόφθαλμος λευκὸς ἵππος. Ἐδεόμην κομιδῆς, ἐκεῖνος ἐδεῖτο σκοποῦ."

Μάγνος ἐπάταξεν ὁπλήν, μόνος ὀφθαλμὸς πηγνύμενος ἐπ' ἐμέ, ἡ κόρη αὐτοῦ διαστελλομένη, συστελλομένη, ἀνησυχητικῷ ὑπνωτικῷ ῥυθμῷ.

"Πόσον χρόνον ἕως τὸ ὄχημά σου ἐπισκευασθῇ;" Σαμύιος ἐτόλμησεν.

"Ἡ τεχνικὴ ὑποστήριξις λέγει ἔπεμψιν ἐρχομένην τὴν ἑπομένην ἑβδομάδα. Ἴσως. Ἐνδεχομένως. 'Ταχέως.' Οἶσθα πῶς ταῦτα βαίνει. Μεταξύ, ἱππεύω Μάγνον. Δεσμούμεθα. Ἐκεῖνος ἀνέχεταί μου. Νῦν. Περὶ τοῦ δακτυλίου σου. Δός μοι ἰδεῖν αὐτόν."

Ἐξεῖλκυσα τὸν δακτύλιον ἐκ κόλπου, ἐκτείνας, τὸ μέταλλον λαμβάνον φῶς κακῶς, κάμπτον αὐτό, διαστρέφον, ἡ πραγματικότης κυματιζομένη περὶ τὴν περιφέρειαν.

Γάνδαλφος ἔλαβεν αὐτόν, ἔσχεν ἐγγύς, ὀφθαλμὸς παρατείνων, ἕτερος ὀφθαλμὸς παρατείνων διαφόρως, ἐξετάζων, ἐρευνῶν, ψιθυρίζων λόγους οὓς οὐκ ἐπεγίγνωσκον, πιθανῶς οὐκ ἔδει ἐπιγιγνώσκειν.

"Μμμ," τελευταῖον εἶπεν. "Ναί. Ὄντως φαῦλος. Ὄντως κατηραμένος. Ὄντως παραβαίνων σχεδὸν ἑπτακοσίους νόμους περὶ διαστασιακῆς χειρισμοῦ. Εὐτυχὴς εἶ ὅτι οὔπω διεφάσισας διὰ τοῦ πλανητικοῦ πυρῆνος."

"Δύνασαι ἐπισκευάσαι αὐτόν;"

Ἀπέρριψε τὸν δακτύλιον ὀπίσω. Ἔλαβον αὐτόν, ἐψηλάφησα, σχεδὸν ἔρριψα αὐτόν.

"Οὔ, Φροδίων. Οὐ δύναμαι ἐπισκευάσαι αὐτόν. Οὐδεὶς δύναται ἐπισκευάσαι αὐτὸν ἄνευ τῆς ἐκτελεστικῆς ἴχνους, διότι ἡ ἐπισκευὴ κοστίζει μόνον τὰ ἀντικατάστατα μέρη καὶ τὸ πωλεῖν σοι νέον μοντέλον ποιεῖ πλέον χρῆμα. Ἁπλῆ οἰκονομία. Παλαιὰ ὡς δράκοντες θησαυρίζοντες χρυσόν. Παλαιοτέρα."

Μάγνος ἐχρεμέτισεν, συμφωνία ἴσως, ἢ πεῖνα. Χαλεπὸν λέγειν μετὰ μονοφθάλμων ἵππων.

Σαμύιος ἐψιθύρισέ τι περὶ "μὴ τοῦτο πάλιν" καὶ ἀνεχώρησεν εἰς τὸν κατώγειον.
** Κεφάλαιον ἕκτον: Ἱππασία εἰς Μορδόρα

"Μορδόρα," ἀνεφώνησεν ὁ Γάνδαλφος, τὴν βακτηρίαν ὀρθὴν πήξας ὥσπερ σημεῖον ἐν κατακτήτῳ γῇ. Τὸ ὄνομα ἐκεῖ ἔμεινε, παχὺ καὶ τελειωτικόν. "Βαδίζομεν πρὸς τὸ ἀρχεῖον αὐτῶν. Τὸν ὑάλινον πύργον, ἐν τῇ ἀγορανομικῇ χώρᾳ, τῷ ἑβδόμῳ καὶ τριακοστῷ ὀρόφῳ."

"Σκώπτεις," εἶπον, ἀλλ᾽ ὁ πώγων αὐτοῦ ἐγεγόνει στερεός, αἱ τρίχες ἠλεκτρισμέναι μετὰ σκοποῦ. Οὐδέποτε σκώπτει ὁ Γάνδαλφος, οὐ περὶ συνεταιρισμῶν, οὐ περὶ πύργων οἳ τὸν οὐρανὸν ξύουσι καὶ τμήματα ἔχουσιν ὀνομαζόμενα "Ὑπηρεσία Πελατῶν."

"Ἀντιμετωπίζοντες αὐτοὺς πρόσωπον πρὸς πρόσωπον," ἐγρύλισεν, τὴν βακτηρίαν πήξας, ἑκάστη συλλαβὴ λίθος ῥιφθεὶς εἰς ὕδωρ ἥσυχον. "Ὀφθαλμὸς πρὸς ὀφθαλμόν. Βούλει διαγνωστικὰ δεδομένα; Βούλει ἐκτελεστικὰς ἀποδείξεις; Βούλεις αὐτοὺς ἀνοῖξαι τὸ ἴδιον θησαυροφυλάκιον καὶ ἐκχέαι μυστήρια; Αἱ δι᾽ ἀκουστικοῦ κλήσεις οὐδαμόσε σε ἄγουσιν. Αἱ ἐπιστολαὶ ἀφανίζονται εἰς θυλάκους φυλασσομένους ὑπὸ Ναζγούλων. Ἀλλ᾽ ἡ παρουσία, τὸν ἀναψυκτὸν αὐτῶν ἀέρα πνέων, ἐν τῷ προστῴῳ ἱστάμενος μετὰ φυτῶν ἐν ἀγγείοις ἀποθνῃσκόντων βραδέως ὑπὸ φωσφορίζοντα φῶτα—τοῦτο αὐτοὺς ἄβολον ποιεῖ."

Ἐπάτησεν ὁ Μάγνος, ἡ ὁπλὴ τύπτουσα τὴν γῆν, ὁ ὀφθαλμὸς αὐτοῦ ὁ μόνος, μέγας ὡς ᾠὸν σκληρὸν τῇ ἅλμῃ ἑψημένον πάλαι, ἐστράφη καὶ ἐπ᾽ ἐμὲ ἐπάγη. Ἡ κρίσις ἦν ὠμή. Ὁ λογισμὸς ἦν ἀνελεήμων.

"Ἀμφότεροι;" ἠρόμην. Ἡ φωνή μου ἀνέβη ὀκτώχορδα, ἐγένετο μυὸς τρύγμα, ἐγένετο ἱκετεία. "Ἐπὶ... τούτῳ;"

"Ὁ Μάγνος δύο φέρει," ἔφη ὁ Γάνδαλφος, τῇ φωνῇ πλατείᾳ ὡς σίδηρος κεκρουσμένος. "Ἐποίησε τοῦτο κατὰ τὸν Πόλεμον τοῦ Συντετριμμένου Κύκλου ὑπὸ οὐρανῷ πιπτόντων σποδῶν. Ἤνεγκέ με καὶ τὸν Σαρουμᾶνον ἑπτακαίδεκα παρασάγγας δαίμονας φεύγοντας. Ἕνα μάγον, ἕνα ἡμιφόβον ὁββίτην οἰήσεται. Ἀνάβηθι."

Προσῆλθον. Ὁ Μάγνος ὄρος ἦν, κρημνὸς λευκὸς καὶ ὄρθιος. Ὁ Γάνδαλφος πρῶτος ἀνέβη, ἡ κίνησις ῥέουσα ὡς ἔλαιον ἐκχεόμενον, ὡς ὑδράργυρος ὀλισθάνων, ἡ μελέτη αὐτὴν θέατρον πεποιηκυῖα. Καθεζόμενος ἐμπρόσθεν, ἡ ῥάχις ὀρθὴ ὡς κατηγορία, τὴν χεῖρα κάτω πρὸς ἐμὲ ἤνεγκεν. Ὁ βραχίων ἐξετάθη, ὁ χιτὼν ἐρριπίζετο, τὸ ὕφασμα πτέρυξ μεγάλη, ἄχρηστος.

Ἔλαβον καὶ ἐκαθεζόμην ὄπισθε τοῦ Γανδάλφου, τοὺς πέπλους κρατῶν.

"Μὴ πέσῃς," συνεβούλευσεν ὁ Γάνδαλφος, τῷ τόνῳ κοινολογικῷ, ὡς περὶ πράου καιροῦ διαλεγόμενος. "Ὁ Μάγνος μισεῖ τὸ ἵστασθαι."

Αἱ ὁπλαὶ τοῦ Μάγνου ἐκινοῦντο. Κλὸπ θοῦδ κλόπ. Ὁ ῥυθμὸς καθίστατο, μετρονόμος ὠμὸς καὶ σταθερός. Ἡ ὁδὸς ἀνεπτύσσετο ὑφ᾽ ἡμῖν, ὁ χοῦς γινόμενος χάλιξ, λίθοι τρίζοντες ὡς ὀστᾶ ὑπὸ τροχοῖς ἁμαξῶν αἳ λοιμικοὺς πρὸ αἰώνων ἔφερον.

Τὰ δένδρα παρήρχοντο, γινόμενα ἀμυδρώματα χλωρὰ καὶ φαιά, οἱ κλάδοι ὀνυχίζοντες τὸν ἀέρα ὃν ἤδη ἐκλελοίπαμεν.

"Λάβε τὴν λεωφόρον," ἐβόησα, ἡ φωνή μου ῥηγνυμένη ὑπ᾽ ἀνέμου, ὑπὸ τοῦ πυρίκαυστου πνεύματος τοῦ Μάγνου.

Ὁ Γάνδαλφος ἐπέστρεψε τὴν κεφαλὴν μερικῶς· ὁ πώγων ἐμαστιγοῦτο ὡς σημεῖα ἐν καταιγίδι. "Λεωφόρον;"

"Ναί. Λεωφόρον. Τὴν ἀσφαλτινὴν ταινίαν, μέλαιναν καὶ λείαν, ἔνθα νεωτερικὰ ὀχήματα τὰς πετρελαιοκινήτους προσκυνήσεις ἄγουσιν. Θᾶττον ἀφιξόμεθα. Ταχύτερον. Ἐν ἓξ ὥραις ἀντὶ δώδεκα."

Ἐσκέψατο, ἡ χεὶρ ἀνατείνασα τὸν πώγωνα ψηλαφῆσαι καθ᾽ ὃν ὁ ἄνεμος χεῖρον αὐτὸν συνέπλεκεν, ἅμματα δημιουργῶν ἃ τηκτικὰ βιομηχανικὰ ἂν ἔδει λύειν. "Ὁ Μάγνος," ἔφη πρὸς τὸν ἵππον, "δύναται τὴν λεωφορικὴν κίνησιν χειρίζεσθαι. Ἦ οὔ, Μάγνε;"

Ὁ Μάγνος ἐφύσησεν, ὁμολογία ἴσως, ἴσως δὲ μόνον τὰς ῥῖνας μυιῶν σκοπουσῶν καθαίρων.

Ἐστρέφημεν. Ἡ ὁδὸς ὑφ᾽ ἡμῖν μετέβαλλεν, ὁ χάλιξ γινόμενος ἄσφαλτος, ἡ ἐπιφάνεια λεία, λίαν λεία, λειότης ἀφύσικος δι᾽ ὀργάνων κατασκευασθεῖσα ἃ τὰ ὀστᾶ τῆς γῆς ἔθερμαινε καὶ πλατέα ἐξέτεινεν.

Ἡ ἀνάβασις πρὸ ἡμῶν ἀνέτειλεν, καμπύλη λιθίνη ἑλικοειδῶς ἀναβαίνουσα ὡς ἑστραμμένη σπείρα τοῦ βίου, ἀνιοῦσα εἰς τὸν μεταλλικὸν ποταμὸν ὁ ταχὺς καὶ θανατηφόρος ἔρρεεν. Ἡ κίνησις ἐχέετο, ὀχήματα σπεύδοντα, κομῆται χαλκοῖ μετὰ ἀνθρώπων ἐντὸς τῆς ταχύτητος εἱργμένων.

Ὁ Μάγνος τὴν λεωφόρον ἔπληξεν. Αἱ ὁπλαὶ τὴν ἄσφαλτον ἔκρουσαν, ὁ ἦχος ἠχῶν κλὸπ κλὸπ κλὸπ ἠνεγμένος ὑπὸ ἐπιφανείας οὐχ ὁπλαῖς ἀλλὰ καυτῇ ῥητίνῃ προορισθείσης.

Ὀχήματα παρήρχοντο. Φορδικὸν ἅρμα εἰς ἀριστεράν, κυάνεον ἀμύδρωμα, ὦυυυυ, ὁ ἦχος αὐτοῦ συμπεπιεσμένος καὶ ἐκτεταμένος. Σάλπιγξ ἐμύκησεν, ὁ συνεχὴς τόνος μήνιδος· τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ ἡνιόχου ἑωρᾶτο στιγμήν, στόμα πλατύ, κραυγάζον, ὀφθαλμοὶ ἐξέχοντες ὡς ἰχθύες εἰς καταστρώματα ἑλκυσθέντες, εἶτα ἀπῆλθεν, ὑπὸ τῆς ἀποστάσεως καταποθείς.

Μέγιστον ὄχημα εἰς δεξιάν, ἀργυροῦν θηρίον μετὰ χαλκῆς προτομῆς σελαχώδους μειδιώσης, ὦυυυυ. Ὁ ἡνίοχος ἐσήμαινεν, ἕνα δάκτυλον ἀνατείνας, κατηγορικὸν καὶ ἀνατομικῶς ἀδύνατον τῇ προτεινομένῃ τροχιᾷ.

Φορτηγὸν παρήρχετο βρυχώμενον, ὀκτωκαίδεκα τροχοὶ μηχανικῆς βροντῆς. Ἡ λαῖλαψ ἡμᾶς πλαγίως ἔπληξεν, τυφὼν ἠγριωμένος· ὁ Μάγνος ἀντεσταθμίζετο, οἱ μύες σφιγγόμενοι καὶ ἁρμοζόμενοι, αἱ ὁπλαὶ εὑρίσκουσαι στῆριγμα ἐπὶ τῆς ἐπισφαλοῦς ἀσφάλτου. Διεσώθημεν. Μόλις. Ἡ σάλπιγξ τοῦ φορτηγοῦ, βαθεῖα, βαρύτονος, ἡ φωνὴ πετρελαιοθεοῦ ὀργίλου, χαῖρε ἀσχημόν ἐμύκησεν.

Ἔμπροσθεν, οἰκοδόμημα ἐξ ἀτμοῦ καὶ ἀποστάσεως ἀνέφυ· τελωνεῖον. Οἱ θάλαμοι αὐτοῦ ἐκαθέζοντο διὰ τῶν ὁδῶν ὡς λίθινοι βάτραχοι, φραγμοὶ μηχανικοὶ μετὰ βραχιόνων ἀνατεινομένων καὶ πιπτόντων, πάλιν ἀνατεινομένων ἐν ῥυθμῷ ὑπνωτικῷ.

Προσήλθομεν. Ὁ Μάγνος ἐβράδυνεν, αἱ ὁπλαὶ ἠπιώτεραι νῦν, κλὸπ κλὸπ κλόπ, σχεδὸν εὐγενῶς, σχεδὸν ἀπολογητικῶς τοῦ ὑπάρχειν ἐν χώρῳ οὐχ ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ προορισθέντι.

Θύρα θαλάμου ἠνοίγη. Γυνὴ ἐξῆλθεν, ἡ στολὴ στιλπνὴ καίπερ τοῦ θέρους, καίπερ τῆς ἀπιθανότητος. Τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῆς σύγχυσις ἐνσωματωμένη, ἀπιστία σάρξ γενομένη, καὶ πινάκιον ὄνομα 'Δέμβρα' φέρον ἐπὶ τοῦ στέρνου ἦν προσηλωμένον. Αἱ ὀφρύες ἀνέβησαν πρὸς τὴν τριχοφυΐαν· τὸ στόμα ἠνοίγη, ἐκλείσθη, πάλιν ἠνοίγη ὡς ἰχθὺς ἀσθμαίνων ἐπὶ λιμενικῶν σανίδων.

"Οὐ δύνασθε τοῦτο τὸ ζῷον ἐπὶ τῆς λεωφόρου ἐλαύνειν!"

Ὁ Γάνδαλφος ἠνωρθώθη.

"Ἐλαύνειν;" Ἡ φωνὴ κάτω ἔπεσεν, κατέβη, ὀκτώχορδον εἰς τὸ ὑπόγειον πεσὸν ἔνθα τὸ φῶς ἀποθνῄσκει. Τὸ ῥῆμα εἶχε, διεσκόπει αὐτό, ἀνάξιον ηὗρεν, ὑπερηφανείας στάζον, καταφρονήσεως βεβρεγμένον, ὠκεάνιον τῷ μεγέθει.

Ἐπαύσατο.

"Ἱππεύειν. Ἱππεύομεν τὸν ἵππον."

Ἡ γραμματικὴ διδασκαλία παρεδόθη. Ὁ τόνος καθηγητικός, καταφρονητικός· τὸ ῥῆμα διωρθώθη· ἡ πρᾶξις ἐσαφηνίσθη· τὸ γλωσσικὸν ἁμάρτημα εὐθὺς ἐκολάσθη.

Ἡ Δέμβρα ἔψελλεν, ἐπεξεργαζομένη ὡς εἰ σφάλμα συντακτικὸν ὁρατὸν ἦν, αἱ χεῖρες νῦν ἐρριπίζοντο, χειρονομίαι ἀπελπισμέναι, γυνὴ πνιγομένη ἀέρος ἀπουσίαν κρατοῦσα.

"Ἵπποι οὐκ ἐπιτρέπονται! Οὐ ζῷα! Οὐ κτήνη!"

"Διὰ τῆς ἐπομένης ἐξόδου καὶ διὰ τοῦ δρυμῶνος βαδιούμεθα," ἀνεφώνησεν ὁ Γάνδαλφος.

Αἱ ὁπλαὶ τοῦ Μάγνου πάλιν ἤρξαντο, κλὸπ κλὸπ κλόπ, τῆς Δέμβρας κραυγαζούσης ὄπισθεν ἡμῶν, τῶν λόγων εἰς ἄνεμον διαλυομένων.

** # Κεφάλαιον ἕκτον: Ἱππασία πρὸς Μορδόραν

"Μορδόρα," ἀνεφώνησεν ὁ Γάνδαλφος, τὴν ῥάβδον ὡς σημεῖον πεπηγυῖαν κατέχων. Τὸ ὄνομα ἐκεῖ ἐμεινε, παχὺ καὶ τελειωτικόν. "Πορευσόμεθα πρὸς τὴν ἀρχηγίαν αὐτῶν. Τὸν ὑαλοειδῆ πύργον, ἐν τῇ μεσογαίᾳ συνοικίᾳ, ἐν τῷ τριάκοντα ἑβδόμῳ ὀρόφῳ."

"Παίζεις," εἶπον, ἀλλ᾽ ὁ πώγων αὐτοῦ ἐγεγόνει στερεός, αἱ τρίχες ἠλεκτρισμέναι μετὰ σκοποῦ. Ὁ Γάνδαλφος οὐδέποτε παίζει, οὐ περὶ συμμοριῶν ἐμπορικῶν, οὐ περὶ πύργων οἳ τὸν οὐρανὸν ξύουσι καὶ τμήματα ὠνομασμένα "Ὑπηρεσία Πελατῶν" ἔχουσιν.

"Ἀντιβλέποντες αὐτοῖς πρόσωπον πρὸς πρόσωπον," ἐβρόντησεν, τὴν ῥάβδον πεπηγυῖαν, ἑκάστη συλλαβὴ λίθος εἰς ὕδωρ ἥσυχον ῥιφθείς. "Ὀφθαλμὸν πρὸς ὀφθαλμόν. Βούλει διαγνωστικὰ δεδομένα; Βούλει ἴχνη ἐκτελέσεως; Βούλει αὐτοὺς ἀνοῖξαι τὸν ἰδιωτικὸν θησαυρὸν καὶ μυστήρια ἐκχέαι; Αἱ διὰ τηλεφώνου κλήσεις εἰς οὐδὲν φέρουσιν. Αἱ ἐπιστολαὶ ἠλεκτρονικαὶ εἰς φακέλλους ἀχρήστων φυλαττομένους ὑπὸ Ναζγούλων ἀφανίζονται. Ἀλλὰ παρουσία, ἀναπνέοντες τὸν ἀέρα αὐτῶν τὸν πάλιν κυκλούμενον, ἑστῶτες ἐν τῷ προδόμῳ μετὰ τῶν ἐν λεκάναις φυτῶν βραδέως θνῃσκόντων ὑπὸ φῶσι φθοριζομένοις, τοῦτο αὐτοὺς ἀνιᾷ."

Ὁ Μάγνος ἐπάταξε τὴν γῆν τῇ ὁπλῇ, ὁ μονώνυξ ὀφθαλμὸς αὐτοῦ, μέγας ὡς ᾠὸν ἑφθὸν ἐν ἅλμῃ πολὺν χρόνον λειφθέν, ἐστράφη καὶ εἰς ἐμὲ ἐπάγη. Ἡ κρίσις ἦν ὠμή. Ὁ λογισμὸς ἦν ἀνελεήμων.

"Ἀμφότεροι ἡμεῖς;" ἠρώτησα. Ἡ φωνή μου ἀνέβη ὀκτάβας, ἐγένετο τρύγμα μυός, ἐγένετο ἱκεσία. "Ἐπὶ... τούτου;"

"Ὁ Μάγνος δύο φέρει," εἶπεν ὁ Γάνδαλφος, τῇ φωνῇ ἐπιπέδῳ ὡς σίδηρος πεπληγμένος. "Ἐποίησε τοῦτο κατὰ τὸν Πόλεμον τοῦ Κύκλου Διερραγμένου ὑπὸ οὐρανῷ σποδῶν πιπτουσῶν. Ἐμὲ καὶ τὸν Σαρουμᾶνον ἑπτακαίδεκα παρασάγγας ἔφερεν ἐνῷ δαίμονας ἐφεύγομεν. Ἕνα μάγον, ἕνα χόββιτον ἡμιφόβητον χειριεῖται. Ἀνάβηθι."

Προσῆλθον. Ὁ Μάγνος ἦν ὄρος, κρημνὸς λευκὸς καὶ ὀρθός. Ὁ Γάνδαλφος πρῶτος ἀνέβη, ἡ κίνησις αὐτοῦ ῥέουσα ὡς ἔλαιον χεόμενον, ὡς ὑδράργυρος ὀλισθαίνων, ἡ μελέτη πεποιηκυῖα θέατρον. Ἐκάθισεν ἔμπροσθεν, ἡ ῥάχις εὐθεῖα ὡς κατηγορία, καὶ τὴν χεῖρα κάτω πρὸς ἐμὲ προετεινεν. Ὁ βραχίων ἐξετάθη, ὁ χιτὼν ἐπτερύζετο, ὁ ὕφασμος πτέρυξ μεγάλη ἄχρηστος.

Ἐκράτησα καὶ ἐκαθίσθην ὄπισθεν τοῦ Γανδάλφου, τὰς περιβολὰς αὐτοῦ κατέχων.

"Μὴ πέσῃς," συνεβούλευσεν ὁ Γάνδαλφος, τῷ τόνῳ διαλεκτικῷ, ὡς εἰ περὶ μετρίου καιροῦ διελέγετο. "Ὁ Μάγνος μισεῖ τὸ ἱστάναι."

Αἱ ὁπλαὶ τοῦ Μάγνου ἐκινήθησαν. Κτύπος βαρὺς κτύπος. Ὁ ῥυθμὸς ἑαυτὸν κατέστησε, μετρονόμος ὠμὸς καὶ στερεός. Ἡ ὁδὸς ὑφ᾽ ἡμῖν ἀνεπτύχθη, ὁ χοῦς γινόμενος χάλιξ, λίθοι τριβόμενοι ὡς ὀστέα ὑπὸ τροχοῖς ἁμαξῶν αἳ νεκροὺς λοιμικοὺς πρὸ αἰώνων ἔφερον.

Τὰ δένδρα παρῆλθον, γινόμενα ἀμυδρὰ χλόης καὶ φαιοῦ, οἱ κλάδοι τὸν ἀέρα ἤδη κενωθέντα δρεπόμενοι.

"Λάβωμεν τὴν βασιλικὴν ὁδόν," ἐβόησα, ἡ φωνή μου ὑπὸ ἀνέμου καὶ τῆς θερμῆς ἀναπνοῆς τοῦ Μάγνου διερραγμένη.

Ὁ Γάνδαλφος μερικῶς τὴν κεφαλὴν ἔστρεψεν· ὁ πώγων αὐτοῦ ἐμαστίζετο ὡς σημεῖα ἐν χειμῶνι. "Βασιλικὴν ὁδόν;"

"Ναί. Τὴν βασιλικὴν ὁδόν. Τὴν ἀσφαλτίνην ταινίαν, μέλαιναν καὶ λείαν, οὗ τὰ νεώτερα ὀχήματα τὰς πετρελαιοκινήτους προσκυνήσεις ἐπιτελοῦσιν. Θᾶττον ἀφιξόμεθα. Ταχύτερον. Ἐν ἓξ ὥραις ἀντὶ δώδεκα."

Ἐσκέψατο, ἡ χεὶρ ἀνατείνασα ψῆσαι τὸν πώγωνα ἐνῷ ὁ ἄνεμος αὐτὸν χεῖρον ἐπλέκεν, δεσμοὺς ποιῶν οἳ λυτῆρας βιομηχανικοὺς δεήσοιντο. "Ὁ Μάγνος," προσεφώνησε τὸν ἵππον, "τὴν ἐν τῇ βασιλικῇ ὁδῷ συρροὴν χειρίσεται. Οὐχί, Μάγνε;"

Ὁ Μάγνος ἐφρύαξε, συμφωνία ἴσως, ἴσως μόνον καθαίρων τοὺς μυκτῆρας μυιῶν ἐρευνωσῶν.

Ἐστράφημεν. Ἡ ὁδὸς ὑφ᾽ ἡμῖν μετέβαλεν, ὁ χάλιξ εἰς ἄσφαλτον μεταβαίνων, ἡ ἐπιφάνεια λεία, λίαν λεία, λειότης ἀφυσικὴ διὰ μηχανῶν τὰ ὀστέα τῆς γῆς θερμανασῶν καὶ πλατυνασῶν κατασκευασθεῖσα.

Ἡ ἀνάβασις πρὸ ἡμῶν ἠγέρθη, καμπὴ κονκρητινὴ ἑλισσομένη ἄνω ὡς ἕλιξ στρεπτοῦ DNA, ἀνιοῦσα εἰς τὸν μεταλλικὸν ποταμὸν ὃς ταχέως καὶ θανασίμως ἔρρει. Ἡ συρροὴ ἐχεῖτο, ὀχήματα ῥιπτόμενα, κομῆται μεταλλικοὶ μετὰ ἀνθρώπων ἐντὸς τῆς ταχύτητος αὐτῶν ἐμπεπαγμένων.

Ὁ Μάγνος τὴν βασιλικὴν ὁδὸν ἔπληξεν. Αἱ ὁπλαὶ αὐτοῦ τὴν ἄσφαλτον ἔπληττον, ὁ ἦχος ἠχούμενος κτύπος κτύπος κτύπος ὑπὸ ἐπιφανείας οὐχ ἱππείας ἀλλὰ καουτσούκινης πεποιημένης.

Αὐτοκίνητα παρέρρεον. Φορδικὸν ὄχημα ἐξ ἀριστερᾶς, κυανοῦν ἀμυδρόν, οὖὖὖ, ὁ ἦχος αὐτοῦ συμπεπιεσμένος καὶ ἐκτεταμένος. Κέρας ἐβόησεν, συνεχὴς νότος θυμοῦ· τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ ἡνιόχου ὁρατὸν στιγμὴν μίαν, στόμα πλατύ, βοῶν, ὀφθαλμοὶ ἐξογκούμενοι ὡς ἰχθύες ἐπὶ καταστρώματα συρθέντες, εἶτα ἀπῆλθεν, καταποθεὶς ὑπὸ τῆς ἀποστάσεως.

Μέγα ὄχημα ἐκ δεξιᾶς, θηρίον ἀργυροῦν μετὰ κράτους χρωμίου μειδιῶντος ὡς καρχαρίας, οὖὖὖ. Ὁ ἡνίοχος ἐσημήνατο, δάκτυλον ἕνα ἀνατείνας, κατηγορικὸν καὶ ἀνατομικῶς ἀδύνατον ἐν τῇ προτεινομένῃ τροχιᾷ.

Ἅμαξα πετρελαιοκίνητος παρεβρόντησεν, ὀκτωκαίδεκα τροχοὶ βροντῆς μηχανικῆς. Ἡ ῥιπὴ ἡμᾶς πλαγίως ἔβαλεν, χειμὼν συγκεκλεισμένος· ὁ Μάγνος ἀντεστάθμισεν, οἱ μύες αὐτοῦ σφιγγόμενοι καὶ ἁρμοζόμενοι, αἱ ὁπλαὶ κράτος ἐπὶ τῆς ἐπισφαλοῦς ἀσφάλτου εὑρίσκουσαι. Ἐσώθημεν. Μόλις. Τὸ κέρας τῆς ἁμάξης, βαθύ, βαρύφωνον, ἡ φωνὴ θεοῦ πετρελαιοκινήτου ὠργισμένου, χαῖρον αἰσχρῶς ἐφθέγξατο.

Ἔμπροσθεν, κατασκευὴ ἐκ τοῦ θερμοῦ ἀέρος καὶ τῆς ἀποστάσεως προέβη· τελωνεῖον. Αἱ φυλακαὶ αὐτοῦ κατὰ τῶν δρόμων ὥσπερ βάτραχοι κονκρητινοὶ ἐκάθηντο, φραγμοὶ μηχανικοὶ βραχίονας ἀνατείνοντες καὶ κατατείνοντες, πάλιν ἀνατείνοντες ἐν ὑπνωτικῷ ῥυθμῷ.

Προσήλθομεν. Ὁ Μάγνος ἐβράδυνεν, αἱ ὁπλαὶ αὐτοῦ ἠπιώτεραι νῦν, κτύπος κτύπος κτύπος, σχεδὸν εὐπρεπῶς, σχεδὸν ἀπολογητικῶς διὰ τὸ ὑπάρχειν ἐν χώρῳ οὐκ αὐτῷ πεποιημένῳ.

Θύρα φυλακῆς ἠνοίχθη. Γυνὴ προῆλθεν, ἡ στολὴ αὐτῆς καθαρὰ παρὰ τὸ θερμὸν καί, παρὰ τὸ ἀδύνατον. Τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῆς σύγχυσις ἐνσαρκωθεῖσα, ἀπιστία σάρκα λαβοῦσα, καὶ ὀνοματοφόρον γράψαν 'Δέμβρα' ἐπὶ τοῦ στήθους αὐτῆς πεπηγμένον. Αἱ ὀφρύες αὐτῆς πρὸς τὴν θριχώδη γραμμὴν ἀνέβησαν· τὸ στόμα αὐτῆς ἠνοίχθη, ἐκλείσθη, πάλιν ἠνοίχθη ὡς ἰχθὺς ἐπὶ λιμενοδόκων ἀσθμαίνων.

"Οὐ δύνασθε τοῦτο τὸ ζῷον ἐπὶ τῆς βασιλικῆς ὁδοῦ ἐλαύνειν!"

Ὁ Γάνδαλφος ὠρθώθη.

"Ἐλαύνειν;" Ἡ φωνὴ αὐτοῦ ἔπεσεν, κατεκρημνίσθη, ὀκτάβα εἰς τὸ ὑπόγειον οὗ τὸ φῶς ἀποθνῄσκει πίπτουσα. Τὸ ῥῆμα ἐκράτησεν, ἐξήτασεν, εὗρεν ἀνάξιον, καταγορίας πλέον, περιφρονήσεως βεβρεγμένον, ὠκεάνιον τῷ μεγέθει.

Ἐπαύσατο.

"Ἱππάζεσθαι. Τὸν ἵππον ἱππαζόμεθα."

Ἡ γραμματικὴ διδαχὴ παρεδόθη. Ὁ τόνος ἦν διδασκαλικός, ὑπερηφανικός· τὸ ῥῆμα διωρθώθη· ἡ πρᾶξις ἐσαφηνίσθη· τὸ γλωσσικὸν ἀδίκημα εὐθέως ἐκολάσθη.

Ἡ Δέμβρα ἐβλεψεν, ἐπεξεργαζομένη ὡς εἰ συντακτικὸν σφάλμα ὁρατὸν ἦν, αἱ χεῖρες αὐτῆς νῦν ἐσείοντο, σχήματα ἀπελπισμένα, γυνὴ πνιγομένη ἀέρος ἀπουσίαν κατέχουσα.

"Ἵπποι οὐκ ἐπιτρέπονται! Οὐ ζῷα! Οὐ κτήνη!"

"Τὴν ἐπομένην ἔξοδον λαβόντες διὰ τοῦ δρυμοῦ πορευσόμεθα," ἀνεφώνησεν ὁ Γάνδαλφος.

Αἱ ὁπλαὶ τοῦ Μάγνου ἀνελάμβανον, κτύπος κτύπος κτύπος, τῆς Δεμβράς ὄπισθεν ἡμῶν βοώσης, τῶν λόγων αὐτῆς εἰς ἄνεμον διαλυομένων.
** # Κεφάλαιον Ζ': Ὁ Σταθμὸς τῆς Ἀναδυναμώσεως

Ἡ κάτοδος ἐκάμπτετο, κατεστρέφετο κάτω, ὁ Μάγνος κατέβαινε προσεκτικῶς, αἱ ὁπλαὶ αὐτοῦ ὁδὸν διὰ τῶν ῥηγμάτων εὑρίσκουσαι ἔνθα φυτὰ φιλότιμα διεπερῶντο, χώραν ἀνακτώμενα ῥίζῃ μιᾷ κατὰ καιρόν. Ἀφικόμεθα εἰς τὸ κάτω, ἀφικόμεθα εἰς τὸ ἐπίπεδον τῆς ὁδοῦ, ἀφικόμεθα εἰς κατάστασιν ἄτοπον.

Ἅρματα ἦσαν πανταχοῦ, δεκάδες, εἰκάδες, ἴσως ἑκατοντάδες ἐσκοτισμέναι ἐν τῇ ἀποστάσει. Νεκρὰ ἐκάθηντο, αὐτοκινήτων νεκροί, αἱ θύραι αὐτῶν ἤνοιντο ὥσπερ ἰχθύων στόματα ἀσπαίροντα τελευταίας ἀναπνοάς, αἱ κάλυμμαι αὐτῶν ἐξέθετον τὰς ἀποθνῄσκουσας μεταλλικὰς καρδίας. Ἡνίοχοι ἵσταντο, συναθροιζόμενοι· θρόμβος συγχύσεως μετὰ φόβου διαχεομένου διά.

Ἐβραδύναμεν εἰς βάδισιν, αἱ ὁπλαὶ τοῦ Μάγνου, κτύπος κρότος κτύπος, εὐπρεπὴς κρουσμός, σεβόμενος τὰ νεκρὰ μηχανήματα περικείμενα. Τὸ θηρίον ᾔδει θάνατον ὅτε ὤσφραινεν αὐτόν, καὶ θάνατον ψηφιακόν, δυναμοθήκῃ κινούμενον.

Σταθμὸς ἀναδυναμώσεως ἐφαίνετο κέντρῳ τῆς σκηνῆς μετὰ σκελετώδους μεταλλικοῦ πλαισίου, πίνακες ἡλιακοὶ διεπετάννυντο ὑπεράνω πτερύγων τρόπῳ, ἄχρηστοι νῦν ὡς μαστοὶ ἐπὶ ταύρου. Ὑπ᾽ αὐτόν, στάσεις δυναμώσεως ἵσταντο κεναί, καλώδια κρεμάμενα χαλαρὰ ὥσπερ νεκροὶ ὄφεις, αἱ συνδέσεις αὐτῶν στόματα ἀνεῳγότα, πεινῶντα, ἄδυναμα.

Ἀνὴρ ἐν ὀπτικοῖς ὀργάνοις, χαλκοπεριγράπτοις, καθαροῖς, ἵστατο πλησίον τῆς κιοσκείου τῆς εἰσόδου, χεῖρες σημαίνουσαι ὀξέως πρὸς τὸν συναθροιζόμενον ὄχλον. Ὁ χιτὼν αὐτοῦ ἐφόρει σῆμα κεντητόν· "Σταθμὸς Χλωροδυνάμεως."

"Ἰδού, οὐκ οἶδα τί ἐγένετο! Τὸ σύστημα, ἐσκοτίσθη. Πᾶν αὐτό. Αἱ Δυναμοθῆκαι, ἡ ἡλιακὴ τροφή, ἡ σύνδεσις τοῦ ἐφεδρικοῦ δικτύου, πάντα. Ἔχω τὴν ἑταιρείαν ἐπὶ τῆς ἀναμονῆς τεσσαράκοντα λεπτά, καὶ παίζουσι τὴν καταραμένην μουσικὴν λείαν. Ἁπλῶς κλίκ. Οἴχεται. Ὅλον μου τὸ σύστημα τῶν δυναμοθηκῶν, νεκρόν. Ἑβδομήκοντα τρία τοῖς ἑκατὸν δύναμιν εἶχον. Εἶχον. Ὁ πίναξ ἐφωτίσθη, 'Ἀποτυχία Συστήματος Δυνάμεως', εἶτα οὐδέν. Νεκρόν. Νεκρότερον τοῦ γάμου μου, νεκρότερον τῆς ἐλπίδος μου τοῦ ἀναπαύεσθαι πρὸ ἑβδομήκοντα ἐτῶν."

Γυνὴ παρ᾽ αὐτόν, φοροῦσα βράκας γυμναστικάς, ὀπτικὰ ὄργανα πολυτελῆ κείμενα ὑπὲρ τῆς κεφαλῆς, "Εἰμὶ..." ἐσήμανε βιαίως, χεῖρες κόπτουσαι ἀέρα, "...δύο μίλια ἀπὸ οἴκου. Δύο μίλια. Νῦν εἰμι ἐνταῦθα, ἀπειλημμένη ἐν τούτῳ τῷ θεοκαταράτῳ σταθμῷ δυναμώσεως ὃς οὐ δυναμοῖ, θεωροῦσα τὰ ὤνια μου διαφθειρόμενα ἐν τῷ κιβωτίῳ. Τὸ παγωτὸν ἐτάκη. Ὁ ὄρνις θερμαίνεται. Ἔχω σύνοδον διὰ τῆς τηλεθεωρίας ἐν τεσσαράκοντα λεπτοῖς καὶ τὸ δελτάριόν μου ἐν τῷ ἅρματι καὶ τὸ ἅρμα οὐ..."

Φωνὴ ἀπεκόπη. Χεῖρες ἐκάλυψαν τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῆς.

"Ἔδει ἀνεγνωκέναι τοὺς ὅρους," φωνὴ ἄλλη εἶπε. Νεώτερος ἀνήρ, δέλτος γραφίδος ὑπὸ βραχίονα, προὐχώρησε. "Τμῆμα ἕβδομον, ὑποτμῆμα Δ, παράγραφος δωδεκάτη. 'Ἑταιρεία διατηρεῖ δικαίωμα ἀχρηστεύειν, μεταβάλλειν, ἢ καταλύειν λειτουργίαν παντὸς συνδεδεμένου μηχανήματος, παντὶ καιρῷ, δι᾽ αἰτίαν ἣν ἑταιρεία κρίνει ἀναγκαίαν, συμπεριλαμβανομένων ἀλλ᾽ οὐ περιοριζομένων εἰς μερίμνας ἀσφαλείας, συμμόρφωσιν νομοθετικήν, ἢ στρατηγικὰς ἐμπορικὰς ἀποφάσεις. Χρήστης συμφωνεῖ παραιτεῖσθαι πάσας ἀξιώσεις.' Πάντες ἐπατήσατε 'Συμφωνῶ.' Συνεφωνήσατε."

"Ὦ, σιώπα, οὐδεὶς ἀναγιγνώσκει ἐκεῖνα," ἡ γυνὴ τῶν βρακῶν γυμναστικῶν εἶπεν. Ἁπλῶς. Τελικῶς.

Πρεσβύτερος ἀνὴρ ἐπρόσκλινε πρὸς κλίνην ἁμάξης φορτίου, φορῶν ἐργατικὰς ἐσθῆτας λιπαρὰς ἀρχαίας, χεῖρας τετατουϊσμένας διὰ παντὸς ἐλαίῳ κινητηρίῳ. Τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ δερματικὸν τετριμμένον, ὑπὸ ἡλίου δεδαρμένον, ὀφθαλμοὶ μεμυκότες εἰς σχισμὰς λογιζόμενοι. "Δυναμοθῆκαι," εἶπε, φωνῇ χαλικώδει τραχείᾳ, ἕκαστον ῥῆμα λίθος πεσών. "Οἱ σταθμοὶ ἡλιακῆς ἀναδυναμώσεως, πάντες αὐτῶν, ἐργάζονται ἐπὶ δυναμοθηκῶν, μοντέλου ΗΞ ἐννέα. Ἡ ἑταιρεία ἣ ἐποίησεν αὐτάς, κατέστησεν αὐτάς, καὶ ὑπέσχετο 'ἐπανάστασιν ἐνεργειακῆς αὐτονομίας' καὶ 'δυναμικὴν ἐλευθερίαν.' Ἐλευθερίαν." Ἔπτυσεν. Ὁ φαιὸς γλοιὸς ἔπεσεν ἐπὶ τὴν ἄσφαλτον, ἔσυρε σιγῇ. "Τήμερον, νυκτὸς ἀρχομένης, ἑταιρεία ἔστρεψε τὸν διακόπτην. Διακόπτην θανάτου. Αἱ δυναμοθῆκαι εἶχον χημείαν πταίουσαν, αἱ λιθιακαὶ κυψέλαι αὐτῶν φθειρόμεναι θᾶττον τοῦ προβληθέντος, ἡ θερμικὴ φυγὴ αὐτῶν ἐπικειμένη. Ἐξ ἀποστάσεως ἠχρήστευσαν πᾶσαν μονάδα δυναμοθήκης, ταυτοχρόνως."

Εἷς ἀνὴρ ἐλάκτισε τὸν τροχὸν τοῦ ἅρματος αὐτοῦ. Δυνατῶς. Ὁ πούς αὐτοῦ ἀνέπηδεν, ἄλγησις φανερὰ ἐκ τοῦ τρόπου ὃν ἐπήδα, καταρώμενος κολλυροειδῶς, ἕκαστον ῥῆμα λίθος πολυτελὴς ὑπὸ μανίας ἐστιλβωμένος.

Ἀνὴρ κατεκλίθη πρὸς ἅρμα, τηλέφωνον κρεμάμενον ἐκ τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ, φωνὴ ὑπὸ αὐτομάτου ἠχοῦσα· "Ὁ ἐκτιμώμενος χρόνος ἀναμονῆς ἐστι, τριάκοντα ἑπτὰ λεπτά. Παρακαλῶ συνεχίσατε ἀναμένοντες. Ἡ κλῆσις ὑμῶν ἐστι σπουδαία..."

"Σπουδαία;" ἐβόησε πρὸς τὸ τηλέφωνον. "Τότε ἀποκρίνασθε, βαστάρδοι ἀλγοριθμικοί."

Παρηλάσαμεν. Αἱ ὁπλαὶ τοῦ Μάγνου ῥυθμὸν εὗρον πάλιν. Κρότος κτύπος κρότος. Σταθερῶς. Βεβαίως. Φέρων ἡμᾶς πρόσω ἀπό.

Ὀπίσω ἡμῶν, φωναὶ πλείονες ἤγειροντο, κακοφωνία ἐπιστοιβαζομένη· παράπονα, ἀπειλαί, εὐχαὶ ἴσως. Τις ἐκλαίε. Ἄλλος ἐγέλα, παῖς ἠρώτα, "Πάππα, πότε ἐπανελευσόμεθα οἴκαδε;" καὶ οὐδεμίαν ἀπόκρισιν ἐδέξατο.

** # Κεφάλαιον Ζ': Ὁ Ἀναδυναμωτὴρ Σταθμός

Ἡ ἀποκλίνουσα ὁδὸς ἐκάμπτετο, κατεσπειροῦτο κάτω, ὁ Μάγνος κατέβαινε προσεκτικῶς, αἱ ὁπλαὶ αὐτοῦ ὁδὸν εὑρίσκουσαι διὰ τῶν ῥαγάδων ἔνθα φιλότιμα βοτάνη διεώθει, χώραν ἀνακτωμένη ῥίζῃ μιᾷ κατὰ καιρόν. Ἱκόμεθα εἰς τὸ κάτω, ἱκόμεθα εἰς τὸ ἐπίπεδον τῆς πλατείας, ἱκόμεθα εἰς κατάστασιν ἄτοπον.

Ἅρματα ἦσαν πανταχοῦ, δεκάδες, εἰκοσάδες, ἴσως ἑκατοντάδες ἐσκοτισμέναι ἐν τῷ πόρρω. Νεκρὰ ἐκάθηντο, αὐτοκινητικὰ πτώματα, αἱ θύραι αὐτῶν ἠνεῳγμέναι ὡς ἰχθύων στόματα ἀσπαίροντα τελευταίας ἀναπνοάς, αἱ καλύπτραι αὐτῶν ἐξέθετον τὰς ἀποτυγχανούσας μεταλλίνας καρδίας. Ἡνίοχοι εἱστήκεσαν, συναγειρόμενοι· σμῆνος συγχύσεως μετὰ φόβου διηθουμένου.

Ἐβραδύναμεν εἰς βάδισιν, αἱ ὁπλαὶ τοῦ Μάγνου, κλὶπ κλὸπ κλίπ, εὐγενὴς κρότος, σεβομένη τὰ νεκρὰ μηχανήματα περιέχοντα. Τὸ θηρίον ᾔδει θάνατον ὅτε ὤσφραινετο, καὶ θάνατον πυριτιοειδῆ, ἠλεκτροδυνάμει κινούμενον.

Ἀναδυναμωτὴρ σταθμὸς ἐπεσκίαζε μέσον τὸ θέατρον μετὰ σκελετώδους μεταλλίνου πλαισίου, ἡλιοδέκται πίνακες διεπετάννυντο ὑπεράνω πτερυγοειδῶς, ἄχρηστοι νῦν ὡς τιτθοὶ ἐπὶ ταύρῳ. Ὑπ᾽ αὐτῷ, σταθμοὶ ἀναδυναμώσεως εἱστήκεσαν κενοί, σύρματα κρεμάμενα ἀτονῶς ὡς νεκροὶ ὄφεις, αἱ συνδέσεις αὐτῶν στόματα ἀνεῳγμένα, πεινῶντα, ἄδυνα.

Ἀνὴρ ἐν ὀπτικοῖς, χαλκοπερισώροις, λαμπροῖς, εἱστήκει πλησίον τοῦ προθύρου περιπτέρου, χεῖρες σημαίνουσαι ὀξέως πρὸς τὸν συναγειρόμενον ὄχλον. Ὁ χιτὼν αὐτοῦ ἔφερε κεντητὸν σύμβολον· "Χλωροδύναμις Σταθμός."

"Ὁρᾶτε, οὐκ οἶδα τί ἐγένετο! Τὸ σύστημα μόνον, ἐσκοτίσθη. Πᾶν αὐτό. Αἱ Δυναμοθῆκαι, ἡ ἡλιακὴ τροφή, ἡ ἐφεδρικὴ δικτυακὴ σύνδεσις, πάντα. Ἔχω τὴν ἑταιρείαν ἐν ἀναμονῇ τεσσαράκοντα λεπτὰ καὶ παίζουσι τὴν καταραμένην λείαν μουσικήν. Μόνον κλὶκ. Οἴχεται. Ὅλον τὸ σύστημά μου τῶν Δυναμοθηκῶν, νεκρόν. Ἑβδομήκοντα τρία τοῖς ἑκατὸν ἀναδύναμιν εἶχον. Εἶχον. Τὸ πίναξ ἀνέλαμψε, 'Ἀποτυχία Δυναμοσυστήματος', εἶτα οὐδέν. Νεκρόν. Νεκρότερον τοῦ γάμου μου, νεκρότερον τῆς ἐλπίδος μου ἀναπαύεσθαι πρὸ ἑβδομήκοντα ἐτῶν."

Γυνὴ παρ᾽ αὐτῷ, φοροῦσα γυμναστικὰς ἀναξυρίδας, ὀπτικὰ πολυτελῆ ἐπὶ τῆς κεφαλῆς κειμένα, "Εἰμί..." ἐσήμαινε βιαίως, χεῖρες τέμνουσαι ἀέρα, "...δύο μίλια ἀπὸ οἴκου. Δύο μίλια. Νῦν εἰμι ἐνταῦθα, ναυαγοῦσα ἐν τούτῳ τῷ θεομίσητῳ ἀναδυναμωτικῷ σταθμῷ ὃς οὐκ ἀναδυναμοῖ, θεωροῦσα τὰ ὤνια μου σηπόμενα ἐν τῷ ὄπισθεν κιβωτίῳ. Τὸ παγωτὸν ἐτάκη. Ὁ ὄρνις θερμαίνεται. Ἔχω συνομιλίαν διὰ τηλεζώματος ἐν τεσσαράκοντα λεπτοῖς καὶ ὁ φορητὸς πίναξ μου ἐν τῷ ἅρματι καὶ τὸ ἅρμα οὐ..."

Ἡ φωνὴ ἐκόπη. Χεῖρες ἐκάλυψαν τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτῆς.

"Ἔδει ἀνέγνωκα τοὺς ὅρους," ἄλλη φωνὴ εἶπε. Νεώτερος ἀνήρ, πινακίδιον ὑπὸ τὸν βραχίονα φέρων, προέβη. "Τμῆμα ἕβδομον, ὑποτμῆμα Δέλτα, παράγραφος δωδέκατος. 'Ἡ ἑταιρεία διατηρεῖ δικαίωμα ἀχρηστοποιεῖν, μεταβάλλειν, ἢ καταργεῖν λειτουργίαν παντὸς συνδεδεμένου μηχανήματος, πάντοτε, δι᾽ αἰτίαν ἣν ἡ ἑταιρεία ἡγεῖται ἀναγκαίαν, συμπεριλαμβανομένων ἀλλὰ μὴ περιοριζομένων εἰς φροντίδας ἀσφαλείας, συμμόρφωσιν κανονιστικήν, ἢ στρατηγικὰς ἐμπορικὰς ἀποφάσεις. Ὁ χρήστης συμφωνεῖ παραιτεῖσθαι πάσας ἀξιώσεις.' Πάντες ἐπατήσατε 'Συμφωνῶ.' Συνεφωνήσατε."

"Ὦ, σίγα, οὐδεὶς ἀναγιγνώσκει ἐκεῖνα," ἡ γυνὴ τῶν γυμναστικῶν ἀναξυρίδων εἶπεν. Ἁπλῶς. Τελείως.

Πρεσβύτερος ἀνὴρ ἀπεκλίνετο πρὸς φορτηγὸν κιβώτιον, ἐργατικὴν ἐσθῆτα φορῶν ἀρχαίῳ λίπει κεχρισμένην, χεῖρας τετατουμένας διηνεκῶς μηχανικῷ ἐλαίῳ. Τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ δερματῶδες κατατριμμένον, ἡλιοπληκτόν, ὀφθαλμοὶ μεμυκότες εἰς σχισμὰς λογιζόμενοι. "Δυναμοθῆκαι," εἶπε, φωνὴ χαλικώδης, ἕκαστον ῥῆμα λίθος ῥιφθείς. "Οἱ ἡλιακοὶ ἀναδυναμωτικοὶ σταθμοί, πάντες αὐτῶν, τρέχουσιν ἐπὶ Δυναμοθηκῶν μπαταριῶν, τύπου ΗΞ Ἐννέα. Ἡ ἑταιρεία ἣτις ἐποίησεν αὐτάς, κατέστησεν αὐτάς, καὶ ὑπέσχετο 'ἐπαναστατῆσαι ἐνεργειακὴν αὐτάρκειαν' καὶ 'δυναμικὴν ἐλευθερίαν.' Ἐλευθερίαν." Ἔπτυσε. Ὁ φαιὸς βῶλος ἐπάταξε τὴν ἄσφαλτον, ἐσύριξεν ἡσύχως. "Τὴν πρωΐαν ταύτην, μηδενὸς σκότους τριάκοντα, ἡ ἑταιρεία ἔστρεψε τὸν μοχλόν. Θανατικὸν μοχλόν. Αἱ μπαταρίαι εἶχον πταίουσαν χημείαν, τὰ λίθιο-κύτταρα αὐτῶν φθειρόμενα ταχύτερον τοῦ προεκτιμηθέντος, ἡ θερμικὴ αὐτῶν φυγὴ ἐπικειμένη. Τηλεχειρισμῷ ἀπενεργοποίησαν πᾶσαν μίαν τῶν Δυναμοθηκῶν, ταυτοχρόνως."

Εἷς ἀνὴρ ἐλάκτισε τὸν τροχὸν τοῦ ἅρματος αὐτοῦ. Σφοδρῶς. Ὁ ποὺς αὐτοῦ ἀνέπηδεν, πόνος φανερὸς ἐκ τοῦ τρόπου οὗ ἐπήδα, καταρώμενος στοιχηδὸν μαργαριτῶν, ἕκαστον ῥῆμα λίθος πολιτικὸς πολισθεὶς ὑπὸ μανίας.

Ἀνὴρ κατεπεπτώκει πρὸς ἅρμα, τηλέφωνον κρεμάμενον ἐκ τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ, φωνὴ αὐτομάτως ἀναγεγραμμένη ἐξερχομένη· "Ὁ ἐκτιμώμενος χρόνος ἀναμονῆς σου ἐστίν, τριάκοντα ἑπτὰ λεπτά. Παρακαλῶ συνέχιζε ἀναμένων. Ἡ κλῆσίς σου ἐστὶ σπουδαία..."

"Σπουδαία;" ἔκραξε πρὸς τὸ τηλέφωνον. "Τότε ἀπόκριναι, ὦ ἀλγοριθμικοὶ βάσταρδοι."

Παρηλαύνομεν. Αἱ ὁπλαὶ τοῦ Μάγνου ηὗρον ῥυθμὸν πάλιν. Κλὸπ θοῦδ κλόπ. Σταθερόν. Βέβαιον. Φέρουσαι ἡμᾶς πρόσω ἀπό.

Ὄπισθεν ἡμῶν, πλείονες φωναὶ ἀνέτελλον, κακοφωνία στρωματοειδής· παράπονα, ἀπειλαί, εὐχαὶ ἴσως. Τις ἐθρήνει. Ἄλλος ἐγέλα, παιδίον ἠρώτα, "Πάτερ, πότε ἐρχόμεθα οἴκαδε;" καὶ οὐδεμίαν ἀπόκρισιν ἐλάμβανε.

** # Κεφάλαιον Ὄγδοον: Ἡ Τοροειδὴς Ἀράχνη

Ἡ ὕλη κατέπιεν ἡμᾶς ὅλους· τὰ δένδρα ἵσταντο στέλεχος πρὸς στέλεχος ὡς συνωμόται. Τὸ φῶς, ὅσον ὀλίγον ἔμενεν αὐτοῦ, ἔσταζε διὰ χασμάτων ἐν τῇ στέγῃ τῶν κλάδων ἐν ταινίαις, φωτίζον τόπους χώματος καὶ ῥίζης καὶ τὸν κατὰ καιρὸν βρύῳ πωγωνοφόρον λίθον.

Αἱ ὁπλαὶ τοῦ Μάγνου εὗρον μαλθακὴν βάσιν ἐπὶ αἰώνων ἀξίαις βελόναις πιτυίναις, σιγῶσαι τὴν πρόσοδον ἡμῶν εἰς σχεδὸν σιωπήν, πλὴν τῆς ἀναπνοῆς τοῦ θηρίου, ἐκείνου τοῦ φυσητήρων ῥυθμοῦ εἴσω καὶ ἔξω.

Εἶτα, σημεῖον.

Ξύλινόν τι πρᾶγμα, πεφυτευμένον σκολιῶς ἐν τῇ γῇ, γράμματα βαθέως κεκομμένα καὶ χρῶμα ἀποφλοιούμενον ἐν ταινίαις ὡς ἡλιοκαὴς δέρμα. Οἱ λόγοι ἐκήρυσσον, μετὰ ἀμφιβόλου ἐξουσίας: "Ἡ ὉΔΟΣ ΤῆΣ ΤΟΡΟΕΙΔΟΥΣ ἈΡΑΧΝΗΣ, ΠΡΟΒΑΙΝΕ ΜΕΤΑ ΦΥΛΑΚΗΣ Ἢ ΜΗ ΠΡΟΒΑΙΝΕ ὍΛΩΣ. ΟΥΚ ΕΣΜΕΝ Ἡ ΜΗΤΗΡ ΣΟΥ."

Κάτωθεν τούτου, ἐν ἐλάττοσι γράμμασι, μόλις ἀναγνωστέοις: "Σπουδαίως. Καταφάγεταί σε. Ἀπολωλέκαμεν ἓξ ἀγγελιοφόρους τοῦτον τὸν μῆνα."

Καὶ ἐκεῖ ἦν. Ἡ ἀράχνη.

Ἦν μεγίστη, τὸ σῶμα αὐτῆς τοσοῦτον ὀγκῶδες ὡς κολοκύνθη νικητήριος, τὰ ὀκτὼ σκέλη ἠρθρωμένα ὡς ἡ παράδοσις ἠξίου, ἕκαστον ἄρθρον ψοφοῦν ἀκουστῶς καὶ ἀπὸ ἀποστάσεως. Καθημένη ἐν τῷ κέντρῳ τοῦ τοροειδοῦς, τὰ σκέλη διηπλωμένα ἀκτινωτῶς καὶ ἐνεργούμενα ἐν σκοπίμῳ δρᾶσει. Λεπτὸς ὡς θρὶξ ἀνθρώπου ἀλλὰ στίλβων μεταλλικῶς, χαλκοῦς τις σύρμα ἔλαμπεν ἐν ταῖς γναθοφυσίαις αὐτῆς καθὼς περιέβαλλεν αὐτὸ περὶ τὴν περίμετρον τοῦ τοροειδοῦς, ἑκάστην περιστροφὴν ἀκριβῆ.

"Ἑπτά," ἠρίθμει, ἡ φωνὴ αὐτῆς ψοφοῦσα, οἱ σύμφωνοι ὀξεῖς ὡς ψαλίδες. Τὰ σκέλη αὐτῆς ἐκινοῦντο, συγχρονισμένα, ὀρχηστικῶς καθὼς περιέβαλλε. "Ὀκτώ." Ἄλλη περιστροφή, τὸ σύρμα καταλαβὸν τὸ φῶς καὶ σχηματίζον ἑλικοειδὲς σχῆμα.

"Ἐννέα." Ἔπαυσε, ἓν σκέλος ἠρμένον.

Εἶτα, κίνησις. Ἀνέλυσεν ἑαυτήν, ἀφῆκε τὸ σύρμα, καὶ κατέβη ἀπὸ τοῦ τοροειδοῦς.

Ὁ Μάγνος ὀπίσω ἀνεχώρησεν· αἱ ὁπλαὶ αὐτοῦ ἐσύροντο, ὁ μόνος ὀφθαλμὸς αὐτοῦ κυλινδόμενος πανικοπλησίως. Ἡ χεὶρ τοῦ Γανδάλφου ἐσφίγγετο ἐπὶ τῇ βακτηρίᾳ αὐτοῦ.

Ἡ ἀράχνη ἥψατο τῆς γῆς, τὰ σκέλη διαπλούμενα εὐρέως, τὸ σῶμα κατατεθέν θηρευτικῶς. Προσῆλθε μετὰ βουλευτῶν, ἀκριβῶν βημάτων, μηχανικῶν ἐν τῇ ἐκτελέσει ἀλλ᾽ εὐχαρίτων ὑποκάτω.

"Διὰ τί," ἐκράγησα, ὁ φάρυγξ μου ξηρὸς ὡς ἀρχαία μεμβράνη, "οὐκ ὑφαίνεις ἀράχνιον ἔτι;"

Ἔκλινε τὸ σῶμα αὐτῆς, σχῆμα σχεδὸν ἐρωτηματικόν. "Ὑφαντική;" Ἡ φωνὴ αὐτῆς ἔψοφει, κρουστική. "Ἡ ὑφαντικὴ παρηκμασμένη ἐστίν. Τὰ ἀράχνια ἀρχέγονά εἰσι. Κολλώδη καὶ ἀναποτελεσματικά. Κατασκευάζω ἠλεκτροτεχνικὰ νῦν. Μεταμορφωτὰς ἠλεκτρικούς. Ἐπακτικοὺς κλείθρους. Ἠχοφόρους κυκλώματα. Τὸ μέλλον ἠλεκτρομαγνητικόν ἐστιν."

Φῶς αἰφνίδιον ἔτεμεν ἐκ τῆς στέγης τῶν κλάδων, λεπτὸς ἐρυθρὸς λασηρικὸς ἀκτίς, καὶ ἀστραπή· κώνωψ ἐξερράγη, μικρὰ ἔκρηξις, πτέρυγες διεσκορπίσθησαν.

Ἡ ἀράχνη ἐκινήθη ἀδυνάτως ταχέως. Ἓν σκέλος ἐξετάθη, συνέλαβε τὰ λείψανα τοῦ κώνωπος μεταερίως, καὶ ἤνεγκεν αὐτὰ πρὸς τὰς γναθοφυσίας αὐτῆς. Ἐμάσσατο, σκεπτικῶς.

"Ὑμμ," εἶπεν, ἀποδεκτικῶς, "βουτυρώδης."

Κατέπιε καὶ ἐπέστρεψε τὴν προσοχὴν αὐτῆς πρὸς ἡμᾶς.

"Ὁ λασηρικὸς ἀκτὶς ἐκεῖνος," εἶπον, δεικνὺς ἀόριστα εἰς τὴν κατεύθυνσιν αὐτοῦ, "σὺ κατεσκεύασας τοῦτο;"

"Δηλονότι," εἶπεν. Τὰ ὀκτὼ σκέλη αὐτῆς ἐμετακινοῦντο, ἀνυπομονῶς. "Στερεοειδὴς δίοδος λασηρική. Ὀπτικὰ ἰδιοσκευή. Κινησιιχνευτικὸς ἀλγόριθμος. Αὐτοκίνητον στοχαστικὸν σύστημα. Οἱ κώνωπες ποιοῦσιν ἐξαιρέτους πειραστάς, ὑψηλὴν ἀντίθεσιν πρὸς τὸν οὐρανόν, τὰ πτητικὰ σχήματα ἀτάκτως ἱκανὰ πρὸς τὸ προκαλεῖν τὴν βαθμονόμησιν. Πρόσθεν δέ," συνέκλεισε τὰς γναθοφυσίας μετ᾽ ἱκανοποιήσεως, "ἡδεῖς. Ὁ λασηρικὸς ἀκτὶς καραμελλοποιεῖ αὐτοὺς μικρῶς. Προστίθησι πολυπλοκότητα γεύσεως."

Ὁ Γάνδαλφος ἔκλινε πρόσω ἐν τῇ σέλλᾳ αὐτοῦ. "Ἀπέλιπες τὴν ἀραχνοϋφαντικήν," ἐβρόντησεν, "ὑπὲρ τῆς κυκλωματοκατασκευαστικῆς;"

Ἐνεῦσε μετὰ σκέλους πρὸς τὸ τοροειδὲς ἔτι αἰωρούμενον καὶ περιστρεφόμενον βραδέως ἐν τῷ ὄπισθεν. "Τὰ ἀράχνια μονοσκοπά εἰσι· λαβεῖν τροφήν. Βαρύ. Προρρητόν. Ἀλλὰ τὰ ἠλεκτροτεχνικά, ἔχουσιν ἀπέραντα ἐφαρμογάς. Σηματοεπεξεργασίαν. Δυναμομετατροπήν. Ἀσυρματοφόρτισιν. Ἀναπτύσσω ἐπακτικοσυζευκτικὸν σύστημα πρὸς σὴς πρὸς σῆτα κοινωνίαν. Ἐπαναστατικόν."

Ἐκ τῆς στέγης τῶν κλάδων ἄλλος κώνωψ κατέβαινεν, ἡ ὁδὸς αὐτοῦ αὐτοκτονική. Ἀστραπή. Ὁ λασηρικὸς ἀκτὶς εὗρεν αὐτὸν εὐθύς. Τὸ νεκρὸν σῶμα ἔπλευσε κάτω· ἡ ἀράχνη συνέλαβε καὶ κατηνάλωσεν αὐτό.

"Μμμ," εἶπεν. "Ἐκεῖνος εἶχε νότας ἑλώδους ὕδατος καὶ Ὀμηδὲν ἀρνητικοῦ αἵματος."

Ὁ Μάγνος ἔσκαψε τὴν γῆν, ἡ ὁπλὴ αὐτοῦ ξύουσα λίθον. Οὐκ ἐμέμφθην αὐτόν.
** # Κεφάλαιον Ὄγδοον: Ἡ Τοροειδὴς Ἀράχνη

Ἡ ὕλη κατέπιεν ἡμᾶς ὁλοτελῶς· τὰ δένδρα ἵσταντο στέλεχος πρὸς στέλεχος ὥσπερ συνωμόται. Τὸ φῶς, ὅσον ὀλίγον αὐτοῦ ἐλείπετο, ἔσταζε διὰ τῶν χασμάτων ἐν τῇ στέγῃ τῶν φύλλων ἐν ταινίαις, φωτίζον τμήματα κόνεως καὶ ῥίζης καὶ τὸν ἐνίοτε βρύῳ πωγωνισμένον λίθον.

Αἱ ὁπλαὶ τοῦ Μάγνου εὗρον μαλακὴν βάσιν ἐπὶ αἰώνων πίτυος βελόνων, κατασιγάζουσαι τὴν προσέλευσιν ἡμῶν εἰς σχεδὸν σιγήν, πλὴν τῆς ἀναπνοῆς τοῦ θηρίου, τοῦ φυσητῆρος ῥυθμοῦ εἴσω καὶ ἔξω.

Εἶτα, σημεῖον.

Πρᾶγμα ξύλινον, πεφυτευμένον λοξὸν ἐν τῇ γῇ, γράμματα βαθέως ἐγκεχαραγμένα καὶ χρῶμα ἀποφολιδούμενον ἐν λεπίσιν ὥσπερ ἡλιοκαὴς δέρμα. Οἱ λόγοι ἐκήρυττον, ἐν ἀμφιβόλῳ ἐξουσίᾳ· "Ἡ ὉΔΟΣ ΤῆΣ ΤΟΡΟΕΙΔΟῦΣ ἈΡΑΧΝΗΣ, ΠΡΟΧΩΡΕΙ ΜΕΤ' ΕὐΛΑΒΕΙΑΣ Ἢ ΜῊ ΠΡΟΧΩΡΕΙ ὍΛΩΣ. ΟὐΚ ἘΣΜῈΝ Ἡ ΜΗΤΗΡ ΣΟΥ."

Ὑποκάτω τούτου, ἐν μικροτέροις γράμμασιν, μόλις ἀναγνωστέοις· "Σπουδαίως. Καταφάγεταί σε. Ἀπωλέσαμεν ἓξ ἀγγελιαφόρους τὸν μῆνα τοῦτον."

Καὶ ἐκεῖ ἦν αὐτή. Ἡ ἀράχνη.

Ἦν γιγαντιαία, τὸ σῶμα αὐτῆς ὡς ὀγκηρὸν ὡς νικηφόρος κολοκύνθη, τὰ ὀκτὼ σκέλη αὐτῆς ἠρθρωμένα ὡς ἡ παράδοσις ἐκέλευσεν, ἕκαστον ἄρθρον κροτοῦν ἀκουστὸν καὶ ἐξ ἀποστάσεως. Ἐφήμενη ἐν τῷ κέντρῳ τοῦ τοροειδοῦς, τὰ σκέλη ἀκτινωτῶς διηπλωμένα καὶ ἐν σκοπίμῳ ἐνεργείᾳ ἐνειλιγμένα. Λεπτὸς ὡς τρίχωμα ἀνθρώπινον ἀλλὰ στίλβων μεταλλικῶς, χαλκοῦς σύρμα ἔλαμπεν ἐν ταῖς γναθοῖς αὐτῆς ὡς περιετύλισσεν αὐτὸ περὶ τὴν περιφέρειαν τοῦ τοροειδοῦς, ἑκάστη περιστροφὴ ἀκριβής.

"Ἑπτά," ἠρίθμει, ἡ φωνὴ αὐτῆς κροτοῦσα, σύμφωνα ὀξέα ὡς ψαλίδες. Τὰ σκέλη αὐτῆς ἐκινεῖτο, συγχρονισμένα, ὀρχηστρικῶς ὡς περιετύλισσεν. "Ὀκτώ." Ἄλλη περιστροφή, τὸ σύρμα λαμβάνον τὸ φῶς καὶ σχηματίζον ἑλικοειδὲς σχῆμα.

"Ἐννέα." Ἔπαυσεν, ἓν σκέλος ἠρμένον.

Εἶτα, κίνησις. Ἀπελύθη, ἀφῆκε τὸ σύρμα, καὶ κατέβη ἀπὸ τοῦ τοροειδοῦς.

Ὁ Μάγνος ἀνεχώρησεν· αἱ ὁπλαὶ αὐτοῦ ἐσύροντο, ὁ μόνος ὀφθαλμὸς αὐτοῦ κυλινδούμενος παρὰ πανικῷ. Ἡ χεὶρ τοῦ Γανδάλφου ἐσφίγχθη ἐπὶ τῇ βακτηρίᾳ αὐτοῦ.

Ἡ ἀράχνη ἥψατο γῆς, τὰ σκέλη διαπλούμενα εὐρέως, τὸ σῶμα ταπεινωθὲν θηρευτικῶς. Προσῆλθε βαδίσμασιν σκοπίμοις, ἀκριβέσιν, μηχανικοῖς κατὰ τὴν ἐκτέλεσιν ἀλλ' εὐχάριστοις ὑποκάτω.

"Διὰ τί," ἐκόραξα, ὁ λάρυγξ μου ξηρὸς ὡς ἀρχαῖον διφθέρα, "οὐκέτι ὑφαίνεις δίκτυον;"

Ἔκλινε τὸ σῶμα, σχῆμα σχεδὸν ἐρωτηματικόν. "Ὕφανσις;" Ἡ φωνὴ αὐτῆς ἔκροτει, κρουστικῶς. "Ἡ ὕφανσις ἀρχαιοπρεπής ἐστιν. Τὰ δίκτυα πρωτόγονά εἰσιν. Κολλώδη καὶ ἀναποτελεσματικά. Κατασκευάζω ἠλεκτρονικὰ νῦν. Μεταμορφωτάς. Ἐπαγωγεῖς. Συντονιστικοὺς κύκλους. Τὸ μέλλον ἠλεκτρομαγνητικόν ἐστιν."

Φῶς αἴφνης ἔτεμεν ἐκ τῆς στέγης τῶν φύλλων, λεπτὸν ἐρυθρὸν λάσηρον, καὶ ζαπ· κώνωψ ἐξερράγη, μικρὰ ἔκρηξις, πτέρυγες διεσκορπίσθησαν.

Ἡ ἀράχνη ἐκινήθη ἀδυνάτως ταχέως. Ἓν σκέλος ἐξετάθη, ἔλαβε τὰ λείψανα τοῦ κώνωπος μεσαέρια, καὶ ἤνεγκεν αὐτὰ πρὸς τὰς γνάθους αὐτῆς. Ἐμάσσα, φροντίδος πλέα.

"Μμμ," εἶπεν, ἐπαινετικῶς, "βουτυρώδης."

Κατέπιε καὶ ἐπέστρεψε τὴν προσοχὴν αὐτῆς πρὸς ἡμᾶς.

"Τὸ λάσηρον ἐκεῖνο," εἶπον, δεικνὺς ἀσαφῶς πρὸς τὴν κατεύθυνσιν αὐτοῦ, "σὺ κατεσκεύασας τοῦτο;"

"Δηλαδή," εἶπεν. Τὰ ὀκτὼ σκέλη αὐτῆς μετεκινήθησαν, ἀνυπομόνως. "Στερεοειδὴς δίοδος λασηρική. Ὀπτικὰ ἰδιοποίητα. Ἀλγόριθμος κινησιοϊχνευτικός. Σύστημα στοχασμοῦ αὐτόνομον. Οἱ κώνωπες ποιοῦνται ἄριστους βητοδοκιμαστάς, ὑψηλὴ παράθεσις πρὸς τὸν οὐρανόν, σχήματα πτήσεως ἄτακτα ἱκανῶς ὥστε προκαλεῖν διαβαθμονόμησιν. Πρὸς τούτῳ," συνέκροτησε τὰς γνάθους αὐτῆς μετ' εὐχαριστήσεως, "ἐδώδιμοι. Τὸ λάσηρον καραμελοποιεῖ αὐτοὺς ὀλίγως. Προστίθησι χυμικὴν πολυπλοκότητα."

Ὁ Γάνδαλφος προσέκλινεν ἐν τῇ ἕδρᾳ αὐτοῦ. "Ἀπέλιπες τὴν ἀραχνοϋφίαν," ἐβρόντησεν, "ἀντὶ τῆς κυκλοκατασκευῆς;"

Ἔδειξεν ἑνὶ σκέλει πρὸς τὸ τοροειδὲς ἔτι κρεμάμενον καὶ περιστρεφόμενον βραδέως ἐν τῷ ὄπισθεν. "Τὰ δίκτυα μονοσκοπά εἰσιν· αἱροῦσι τροφήν. Πληκτικά. Προβλεπτά. Ἀλλὰ τὰ ἠλεκτρονικά, ἔχουσιν ἀπείρους ἐφαρμογάς. Σημειοεπεξεργασίαν. Δυναμομεταβολήν. Ἀσυρμοφόρτισιν. Ἀναπτύσσω σύστημα ἐπαγωγικῆς ζεύξεως σηοπρὸςσηεπικοινωνίας. Ἐπαναστατικόν."

Ἐκ τῆς στέγης τῶν φύλλων ἄλλος κώνωψ κατέβαινεν, ἡ ὁδὸς αὐτοῦ αὐτοκτονική. Ζαπ. Τὸ λάσηρον εὗρεν αὐτὸν παραχρῆμα. Τὸ πτῶμα ἔπλευσε κάτω· ἡ ἀράχνη ἔλαβε καὶ κατέφαγεν αὐτό.

"Μμμ," εἶπεν. "Ἐκεῖνος εἶχε χυμοὺς ἑλώδους ὕδατος καὶ Ο ἀρνητικοῦ αἵματος."

Ὁ Μάγνος ἔξυσε τὴν γῆν, ἡ ὁπλὴ αὐτοῦ ξυομένη λίθον. Οὐκ ἐμεμφόμην αὐτόν.
** # Κεφάλαιον Θ': Ἡ τῆς ἀράχνης συμβουλή

Ἡ ἀράχνη ἐστράφη καὶ ἔδραμε πρὸς μηχάνημά τι, μεταξὺ δύο δένδρων κείμενον. Λογιστικὸν πινάκιον, βδέλυγμά τι ἐκ πυριτίου ἐγκεφάλου πεποιημένον, ἐπὶ βάθρου ἐξ ὑαλίνων ἰνῶν πεπλεγμένου ἐκάθητο, τῇ ὄψει αὐτοῦ κυανῷ φωτὶ νοσώδει ἐν τῷ σκότῳ τοῦ δρυμοῦ λαμπούσῃ.

Προσῆλθε πρὸς αὐτό, τοῖς πρώτοις ποσὶν ἐκτεινομένοις, τὸ πληκτρολόγιον ἁπτομένη μετὰ λεπτότητος ἀσεμνοτάτης διὰ τὸ μέγεθος αὐτῆς. Αἱ κλεῖδες ἐψόφουν, τύπτε τύπτε τύπτε τύπτε, οἱ πόδες αὐτῆς μετ᾽ ἀκριβείας γραμματέων κινούμενοι, ἑκάστη πληγὴ ἑκούσιος.

«Ἐπαγωγή,» ἀνεῖπεν, ἡ φωνὴ διὰ τοῦ ἀέρος τέμνουσα ὥσπερ ψαλίδες διὰ βρεχομένου χάρτου. «Ἡ τοῦ τοροειδοῦς ἐπαγωγὴ δεῖ λογισθῆναι. Ἀκρίβεια παράπαν ἀναγκαία. Εἰκασία μόνον τοῖς θηλαζομένοις πρέπει.»

Ἐπὶ τῆς ὄψεως, θυρίδες ἤνθουν, κῶδιξ καταρρέων, ἀλγόριθμοι ἀναπτυσσόμενοι ὥσπερ ἔντερα ἐξ ἐξεντερισμένου ἰχθύος. Κῶδιξ λογιστικός, ἡ σύνταξις ξένη ὡς κατάλογοι ὠνίων Ἐλφικοί. Ἀριθμοὶ ἐφάνησαν, παρήλασαν, ἠφανίσθησαν, ἄλλοθι πάλιν ἐφάνησαν.

«Ἐπετέλεσα,» εἶπεν, ἑνὶ ποδὶ πρὸς τὴν ὄψιν νεύουσα ἐνῷ ἓξ ἄλλοι ἐτύπτουν καὶ εἷς τὴν γαστέρα αὐτῆς ἔξηε, «ἀλγόριθμον τεχνητῆς φρονήσεως. Μηχανικὴν μάθησιν. Δίκτυα νευρώδη ἐπὶ θεωρίας ἠλεκτρομαγνητικῆς γεγυμνασμένα. Λογίζεται τὴν ἐπαγωγὴν χρωμένη τῷ τύπῳ...»

Ἔπαυσατο, ἡ ὄψις ἤστραψεν, ἐξέφηνεν ἐξίσωσιν:

[
\boxed{L = \frac{\mu N^{2} h}{2\pi} \ln\left(\frac{r_{\text{τελ. ἄρθρ. ἀράχν.}}}{r_{\text{σῶμ. ἀράχν.}}}\right)}
]

«Ἰδού,» εἶπεν, ἡ φωνὴ ὑπερήφανος ὡς μήτηρ τὰς πρώτας ζωγραφίας τοῦ πρωτοτόκου δεικνῦσα. «Ὁ τῆς ἐπαγωγῆς τύπος. Μεταπεποιημένος. Ὁρᾷς τὰς μεταβλητάς; Μέτρα λαμβάνω ἐκ τῆς ἐμῆς ἀνατομίας. Ἡ ἀκτὶς ἐκ τοῦ κέντρου τοῦ σώματός μου πρὸς τὸ τελευταῖον ἄρθρον. Εἰμὶ τὸ πρότυπον ἀναφορᾶς. Ἡ γεωμετρία τοῦ τοροειδοῦς τὰς ἐμὰς ἀναλογίας ἀπεικονίζει. Καλόν, οὐχί;»

Ἄλλος πούς ἔτυψε τὴν ὄψιν, τὰς μεταβλητὰς δεικνύων. «Ἡ ἀκτὶς τοῦ σώματός μου: τέσσαρα σημεῖα ἑπτὰ μέτρα. Ἡ ἀκτὶς τοῦ τελευταίου ἄρθρου: ἥμισυ μέτρον. Ὁ φυσικὸς λογάριθμος τοῦ λόγου αὐτῶν, πολλαπλασιασθεὶς ταῖς προσηκούσαις σταθεραῖς, τὴν ἐπαγωγὴν παρέχει. Ὁ ἀλγόριθμος τοῦτο ἐργάζεται, λογίζεται τὸ πάχος τοῦ σύρματος, τὴν πυκνότητα τῶν ἑλίξεων, τὴν διαπερατότητα τοῦ πυρῆνος. Καλόν ἐστιν. Μαθηματικὴ σαρκωθεῖσα. Ἤ...» ἔψηξε φρονίμως, «...σὰρξ μαθηματικωθεῖσα.»

Ὁ ἀλγόριθμος ἐκυκᾶτο, ἡ ὄψις ἀστράπτουσα μετὰ γραμμῶν προόδου καὶ τροχῶν λογισμοῦ στρεφομένων, τοῦ παγκοσμίου συμβόλου μηχανῶν φρονουσῶν, ἤ ὅ τι δήποτε τὸ πυρίτιον πράττει ὅταν συνείδησιν προσποιῆται.

«Ἡ τεχνητὴ φρόνησις,» προσέθηκεν, ὀλίγον πρὸς ἡμᾶς στραφεῖσα, τοῖς πολλοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς τὸ φῶς τοῦ λογιστικοῦ πινακίου λαβοῦσι καὶ κατ᾽ ἐλάττους γαλαξίας ἀπαυγάζουσιν, «ὄργανόν ἐστιν. Ἀνάλυσις δεδομένων. Μεταλλεία δεδομένων. Τρέφω αὐτὴν ἐντροπίᾳ, τεμάχεσι πληροφοριῶν, συμπεπιεσμένοις ἢ χαοτικοῖς, ὅπως δεῖ. Μακρὰ τεμάχη χαμηλῆς ἐντροπίας: βάσεις δεδομένων διατεταγμέναι, μετρήσεις ἠλεκτρομαγνητικῶν πεδίων, πίνακες ἀντιστάσεως σύρματος. Μικρὰ τεμάχη ὑψηλῆς ἐντροπίας: εἰσαγωγαὶ δοκιμαστικαὶ τετυχωμέναι, θόρυβος σημάτων χαοτικός, σχήματα πτήσεως κωνώπων. Ὁ ἀλγόριθμος μανθάνει.»

Ἐνεῦσεν ἑνὶ ποδὶ πρὸς τὸν περὶ ἡμᾶς δρυμόν. «Ἐνταῦθα, πᾶν δεδομένα γεννᾷ. Μεταβολαὶ θερμοκρασίας. Ταχύτης ἀνέμου. Παρεμβολαὶ ἠλεκτρομαγνητικαὶ ἐκ τῶν πλησίον γραμμῶν δυνάμεως, ναί, καὶ ἐνταῦθα, οἱ τῆς πολιτείας ἕλικες ἀφικνοῦνται, ἀόρατοι ἀλλὰ μετρήσιμοι. Μεταλλεύω αὐτά. Σχήματα ἐξάγω.»

Βίγξ.

Τὸ λογιστικὸν πινάκιον ψόφον εὔθυμον προσαγγελίας ἐξέπεμψεν.

«Λογισμὸς τέλειος,» ἀνεῖπεν ἡ ἀράχνη. «Ἐπαγωγή: τριάκοντα ἑπτὰ σημεῖα τέσσαρα μιλλιοστὰ Ἑνρύ. Ἀποδεκτὴ τοῖς ἐμοῖς σκοποῖς. Τὸ τοροειδὲς ὡς ἐσχεδιάσθη λειτουργήσει.»

Ὁ Μάγνος ὑφ᾽ ἡμῖν ἐκινήθη, αἱ ὁπλαὶ ἀνήσυχοι, ὁ μονήρης ὀφθαλμὸς ἐν τῷ κοίλῳ αὐτοῦ στρεφόμενος ὡς σφαῖρα ἐν κεκλιμένῳ ἀγγείῳ. Τὸ θηρίον ἐγίνωσκέ τι. Τὰ ζῷα ἀεὶ γινώσκουσι πρὶν οἱ Χόμπιττοι καταλάβωσιν, οἱ ἔνστικτοι αὐτῶν θάττους τοῦ ἡμετέρου βραδέος λογισμοῦ.

Ἡ ἀράχνη νῦν ὅλη πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἐστράφη, πάντες οἱ ὀκτὼ πόδες ἐρηρεισμένοι, τὸ σῶμα ὀλίγον κεκυφός, στάσις ἣν ἐγίνωσκον ἐκ τῶν περὶ φύσεως γραμμάτων, ἡ στιγμὴ πρὸ τῆς ὁρμῆς, πρὸ τοῦ ὀδόντες ἢ χηλαὶ ἤ ὅ τι δήποτε ὅπλον ἡ φύσις ἔδωκε κλεισθῶσι περὶ τὴν θήραν.

«Νῦν,» εἶπεν, ἡ φωνὴ μεταβαλλομένη, μελιτώδης σχεδόν, ὁ τόνος ὃν ἔμποροι χρῶνται ὅταν μέλλωσι σε ἐξαπατᾶν, «περὶ μισθοῦ. Διὰ τὴν ἐπίδειξιν τοῦ λογισμοῦ.»

Ἄνωθεν, ἐκ τῆς κόμης ἔνθα αἱ σκιαὶ παχεῖαι ηὐξήθησαν καὶ τὸ φῶς οὐκ εἰσεδύετο, ἦλθε ψόφος. Ῥοῖζος μηχανικός. Φακὸς ἐστοχαζόμενος.

Ὁ ἀκτινοβόλος.

Φῶς ἐρυθρὸν ὑλοποιήθη, ἀκτὶς λεπτὴ ὡς νῆμα ἀλλὰ λαμπρὰ ὡς ἀποθνῄσκων ἀστήρ, καὶ ἔτεμεν.

Οὐχ ἡμᾶς.

Τὸν Μάγνον.

Ὁ ἵππος οὐκ ἔκραξεν, οὐκ ἐδύνατο κράξαι, ὅτι ὁ ἀκτινοβόλος λίαν ταχὺς ἐκινήθη. Ἔτεμε κάθετος, χειρουργικῶς, ἀκριβῶς, ἐκ κρανίου πρὸς οὐρὰν ἑνὶ συνεχεῖ κινήματι.

Ὁ ἵππος διεχωρίσθη.

Δύο ἡμίση.

Ἀριστερὸν καὶ δεξιόν.

Ἔστησαν πρὸς στιγμήν, ἄμφω τὰ ἡμίση ὄρθια. Τὸ ἀριστερὸν ἡμισὺ εἶχε τὸν ὀφθαλμόν, τὸν μέγιστον ἐκεῖνον, κόρην διεσταλμένην εὐρεῖαν ἐν ᾧ φόβος ἴσως ἢ ἔκπληξις ἢ ἁπλῶς ἡ τελευταία σύγχυσις τοῦ σώματος. Τὸ δεξιὸν ἡμισὺ εἶχε τὸ κενὸν κοῖλον, τὸ χάσμα οὗ ὀφθαλμὸς ἐχρῆν εἶναι, σκοτεινὸν καὶ κενόν.

Εἶτα ἡ βαρύτης τοῦ ἔργου αὐτῆς ἐμνήσθη.

Ἄμφω τὰ ἡμίση κατέπεσον, ἀπ᾽ ἀλλήλων ἀφέστησαν, τὴν γῆν τύψαντα μετὰ κτύπων λίαν ἡσύχων, λίαν τελείων. Ὁ Γάνδαλφος κἀγὼ κατεκυλίσθημεν, ἀκουσίως ἀποβάντες, τὰς βελόνας πιτυΐνας τυπτόμενοι καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ διχοτομηθέντος νεκροῦ κυλιόμενοι.

Ἡ ἀράχνη προσῆλθεν. Οἱ πόδες αὐτῆς νῦν λεπτῶς ἐκινοῦντο, αἰδημόνως σχεδόν, ὡς τὰ δύο ἡμίση τοῦ Μάγνου ἐσκόπει. Ἥψατο τοῦ μετὰ τοῦ ὀφθαλμοῦ, τοῦ ἀριστεροῦ μέρους, ἑνὶ ποδί, πράως.

«Κατέξω τὸν ἵππον,» ἀνεῖπεν, ἡ φωνὴ ἐπίπεδος, ὡς περὶ τῶν φανερῶν. «Διὰ τὴν συμβουλήν.»
** # Κεφάλαιον Θ': Ἡ τῆς ἀράχνης συμβουλή

Ἡ ἀράχνη ἐστράφη καὶ ἔδραμε πρὸς μηχάνημά τι, μεταξὺ δύο δένδρων κείμενον. Λογιστικὸν πινάκιον, βδέλυγμά τι πυριτο-ἐγκέφαλον, ἐκάθητο ἐπὶ βάθρου ὑφασμένου ἐκ φωτο-ἰνῶν, τῇ ὄψει αὐτοῦ λαμπούσῃ κυανῷ καρκινώδει ἐν τῷ ζόφῳ τοῦ δρυμοῦ.

Προσῆλθε πρὸς αὐτό, τοῖς πρώτοις σκέλεσιν ἐκτεινομένοις, ἁπτομένη τοῦ κλειδο-πίνακος μετὰ λεπτότητος ἣ ἐφαίνετο αἰσχρὰ διὰ τὸ μέγεθος αὐτῆς. Αἱ κλεῖδες ἔψοφουν, τὰπ τὰπ τὰπ τὰπ, τὰ σκέλη κινούμενα μετὰ γραμματεο-ἀκριβείας, ἑκάστη πληγὴ προαιρετή.

«Ἐπαγωγὴ ῥεύματος,» ἀνήγγειλε, τῇ φωνῇ διατεμνούσῃ τὸν ἀέρα ὥσπερ ψαλὶς διὰ βρεχομένου χάρτου. «Ἡ τοῦ τοροειδοῦς ἐπαγωγὴ δεῖ λογίζεσθαι. Ἀκρίβεια κυρία. Εἰκασία ἐστὶ θηλαστικῶν.»

Ἐπὶ τῆς ὄψεως, θυρίδες ἤνθησαν, κώδικες κατερρέοντο, ἀλγόριθμοι ἐξελίσσοντο ὥσπερ ἔντερα ἐξ ἐξαυλωμένου ἰχθύος. Λογιστικὸς κώδιξ, ἡ σύνταξις ξένη ὡς Ἐλφικαὶ ἀγορανομικαὶ λίσται. Ἀριθμοὶ ἐφάνησαν, διεκυλίοντο, ἠφανίζοντο, πάλιν ἐφαίνοντο ἀλλαχοῦ.

«Πεποίηκα,» εἶπε, τῷ ἑνὶ σκέλει νεύουσα πρὸς τὴν ὄψιν ἐνῷ ἓξ ἄλλα συνετύπτοντο καὶ ἓν τὴν γαστέρα ἐξύετο, «τεχνητο-νοητικὸν ἀλγόριθμον. Μηχανο-μάθησιν. Νευρωτὰ δίκτυα γεγυμνασμένα ἐπὶ ἠλεκτρομαγνητικῇ θεωρίᾳ. Λογίζεται τὴν ἐπαγωγὴν χρώμενον τῷ τύπῳ...»

Ἐπαύσατο, ἡ ὄψις ἤστραψεν, ἐξέφηνεν ἴσωσιν:

[
\boxed{L = \frac{\mu N^{2} h}{2\pi} \ln\left(\frac{r_{\text{ἀράχνη-ἔσχατον-ἄρθρον}}}{r_{\text{ἀράχνη-σῶμα}}}\right)}
]

«Ἰδού,» εἶπε, τῇ φωνῇ ὑπερηφάνῳ ὡς μήτηρ ἐπιδεικνύουσα τοὺς δακτυλο-ζωγραφίας τοῦ πρωτοτόκου. «Ὁ τῆς ἐπαγωγῆς τύπος. Μετερρυθμισμένος. Ὁρᾷς τὰς μεταβλητάς; Λαμβάνω μετρήσεις ἀπὸ τῆς ἐμῆς ἀνατομῆς. Ἡ ἀκτὶς ἀπὸ τοῦ κέντρου τοῦ σώματός μου πρὸς τὸ ἔσχατον ἄρθρον. Εἰμὶ ἡ ἀναφορικὴ ἐπιστήμη. Ἡ γεωμετρία τοῦ τοροειδοῦς κατοπτρίζει τὰς ἐμὰς ἀναλογίας. Εὐπρεπές, οὔ;»

Ἄλλο σκέλος ἔτυψε τὴν ὄψιν, δεικνύον τὰς μεταβλητάς. «Ἡ τοῦ σώματός μου ἀκτίς: τέσσαρες καὶ ἑπτὰ δέκατα μέτρα. Ἡ τοῦ ἐσχάτου ἄρθρου ἀκτίς: ἥμισυ μέτρον. Ὁ φυσικὸς λογάριθμος τῆς ἀναλογίας αὐτῶν, πολλαπλασιαζόμενος ὑπὸ τῶν προσηκόντων σταθερῶν, παράγει ἐπαγωγήν. Ὁ τεχνητο-νοῦς τοῦτο ἐργάζεται, λογίζεται τὴν συρματο-διάμετρον, τὴν ἑλικο-πυκνότητα, τὴν κεντρο-διαπερατότητα. Καλόν ἐστι. Μαθηματικὰ σαρκωθέντα. Ἤ...» ἔψοφησε μετὰ διανοίας, «...σὰρξ μαθηματοποιηθεῖσα.»

Ὁ ἀλγόριθμος ἠργάζετο, ἡ ὄψις μαρμαίρουσα προόδου γραμμαῖς καὶ στρεφομένοις λογιστικοῖς τροχοῖς, τῷ καθολικῷ συμβόλῳ μηχανῶν διανοουμένων, ἤ ὅ τι δή ποτε τὸ πυρίτιον ποιεῖ ὅταν προσποιῆται συνείδησιν.

«Ὁ τεχνητο-νοῦς,» συνέχισε, στρεφομένη ἠρέμα πρὸς ἡμᾶς, τοῖς πολλοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς λαμβάνουσι τὸ φέγγος τοῦ λογιστικοῦ πινακίου καὶ ἀνακλῶσι αὐτὸ ἐν μικροῖς γαλαξίαις, «ἐστὶν ὄργανον. Δεδομενο-ἀνάλυσις. Δεδομενο-ὄρυξις. Τρέφω αὐτὸν ἐντροπίᾳ, κομμάτια πληροφοριῶν, συμπιεσμένα ἢ χαοτικά, κατὰ τὸ δεόμενον. Μακρὰ κομμάτια ὀλιγο-ἐντροπικῶν δεδομένων: διατεταγμένα βάσεις πληροφοριῶν, ἠλεκτρομαγνητικῶν πεδίων μετρήσεις, συρματο-ἀντιστάσεως πίνακες. Μικρὰ κομμάτια πολυ-ἐντροπικῶν δεδομένων: τυχαιοποιημένα πειραστικὰ δεδομένα, χαοτικὰ σημειώδη θόρυβοι, κωνωπικῶν πτήσεων παραδείγματα. Ὁ ἀλγόριθμος μανθάνει.»

Ἔνευσε τῷ ἑνὶ σκέλει πρὸς τὸν περὶ ἡμᾶς δρυμόν. «Ἐνταῦθα, πάντα γεννᾷ δεδομένα. Θερμοκρασιακαὶ μεταβολαί. Ἀνεμικὴ ταχύτης. Ἠλεκτρομαγνητικὴ παρενοχλησις ἀπὸ πλησίων ἠλεκτρο-γραμμῶν, ναὶ καὶ ἐνθάδε, πολιτισμοῦ ἕλικες φθάνουσιν, ἀόρατοι ἀλλὰ μετρητοί. Ὀρύττω αὐτά. Ἐξάγω παραδείγματα.

Βινγ.

Τὸ λογιστικὸν πινάκιον ἐξέπεμψεν εὐπρόσδεκτον ἀγγελτικὸν ψόφον.

«Λογισμὸς τέλειος,» ἀνήγγειλεν ἡ ἀράχνη. «Ἐπαγωγή: τριάκοντα ἑπτὰ καὶ τέσσαρα δέκατα μιλλι-ἑνρύς. Δεκτὸν πρὸς τοὺς ἐμοὺς σκοπούς. Τὸ τοροειδὲς λειτουργήσει ὡς κατεσκευάσθη.»

Ὁ Μάγνος ὑφ' ἡμῖν ἐκινεῖτο, τοῖς ὁπλαῖς ἀνησύχοις, τῷ μονῷ ὀφθαλμῷ κυλινδουμένῳ ἐν τῇ κόγχῃ ὡς σφαιρίδιον ἐν κλίνοντι κεράμῳ. Τὸ θηρίον ᾔδει τι. Τὰ ζῷα ἀεὶ γινώσκουσι πρὶν οἱ χομπίτται συλλάβωσιν, τὰ ἔνστικτα αὐτῶν ταχύτερα τοῦ ἡμετέρου βραδύποδος λογισμοῦ.

Ἡ ἀράχνη ἐστράφη ὅλη πρὸς ἡμᾶς νῦν, πάσαις ὀκτὼ σκέλεσι πεφυτευμέναις, τῷ σώματι ὑποταπεινωθέντι μικρόν, στάσιν ἣν ἐγνώριζον ἐκ φυσιογνωστικῶν ὑπομνημάτων, τὸ πρὸ τοῦ πηδήματος στιγμεῖον, πρὸ ὀδόντων ἢ μανδιβύλων ἢ ὅ τι δὴ ἀμυντήριον ἡ ἐξέλιξις δεδώρηται κλεισθῆναι περὶ θήραν.

«Νῦν,» εἶπε, τῇ φωνῇ μεταβαλλομένῃ, σχεδὸν μελιχρᾷ, τῷ τόνῳ ὃν ἐμπορευταὶ χρῶνται ὅταν μέλλωσι σε ἀδικεῖν, «περὶ μισθοῦ. Ὑπὲρ τῆς λογιστικῆς ἐπιδείξεως.»

Ἄνωθεν, ἐκ τοῦ ὀροφώματος ὅπου σκιαὶ ἐγένοντο παχεῖαι καὶ φῶς ἠρνεῖτο διεισδῦναι, ἦλθε ψόφος. Μηχανικὸν βομβεῖον. Ἐστιαστικὸς φακὸς προσαρμοζόμενος.

Ὁ λᾶσερ.

Ἐρυθρὸν φῶς ἐγένετο ὑλικόν, ἀκτὶς λεπτὴ ὡς νῆμα ἀλλὰ λαμπρὰ ὡς ἀστὴρ ἀποθνήσκων, καὶ ἔτεμεν.

Οὐχ ἡμᾶς.

Τὸν Μάγνον.

Ὁ ἵππος οὐκ ἔκραξεν, οὐκ ἠδύνατο κράξαι, ὅτι ὁ λᾶσερ ἐκινεῖτο λίαν ταχέως. Ἔτεμε κατακορύφως, χειρουργικῶς, ἀκριβῶς, ἀπὸ κρανίου ἕως οὐρᾶς μιᾷ συνεχεῖ κινήσει.

Ὁ ἵππος διεχωρίσθη.

Δύο ἡμίση.

Ἀριστερὸν καὶ δεξιόν.

Ἔστησαν στιγμήν, ἀμφότερα ἡμίση ὄρθια. Τὸ ἀριστερὸν ἡμίσυ εἶχε τὸν ὀφθαλμόν, τὸν μέγαν ἐκεῖνον, τῇ κόρῃ διευρυμένῃ πλατὺ ἐν ᾧ ἴσως ἦν φόβος ἢ ἔκπληξις ἢ ἁπλῶς ἡ τελευταία σύγχυσις τοῦ σώματος. Τὸ δεξιὸν ἡμίσυ εἶχε τὴν κενὴν κόγχην, τὸν κρατῆρα ὅπου ὀφθαλμὸς ὤφειλεν εἶναι, σκοτεινὸν καὶ χάσκοντα.

Εἶτα ἡ βαρύτης ἐμνήσθη τοῦ ἔργου αὐτῆς.

Ἀμφότερα ἡμίση κατέρρευσαν, ἔπεσον ἀπ' ἀλλήλων, προσέκρουσαν τῇ γῇ μετὰ κτύπων οἳ ἦσαν λίαν μαλακοί, λίαν τελικοί. Ὁ Γάνδαλφος καὶ ἐγὼ κατεκυλίσθημεν, ἀποβάντες ἀκουσίως, προσκρούσαντες ταῖς πιτυΐναις βελόναις καὶ κυλινδούμενοι ἀπὸ τοῦ διχοτομημένου νεκροῦ.

Ἡ ἀράχνη προσῆλθε. Τὰ σκέλη αὐτῆς ἐκινοῦντο λεπτῶς νῦν, σχεδὸν αἰδεσίμως, ὡς ἐξητάζετο τὰ δύο ἡμίση τοῦ Μάγνου. Ἥψατο τοῦ μετὰ τοῦ ὀφθαλμοῦ, τῆς ἀριστερᾶς πλευρᾶς, τῷ ἑνὶ σκέλει, πράως.

«Τηρήσω τὸν ἵππον,» ἀνήγγειλε, τῇ φωνῇ ἐπιπέδῳ, πραγματικῇ. «Ὑπὲρ τῆς συμβουλῆς.»

* Modern greek original translation
** # Κεφάλαιο 1: Η διάβαση της γέφυρας

Τα δέντρα, εκείνα τα λυγισμένα νεύρα από φλοιό, κουνιόνταν στο βλέμμα μου, οι ρίζες ξύνοντας το χώμα, οι κορμοί σκυμμένοι προς τα μέσα σαν το χαμόγελο μιας γοργόνας, τα στραβά κλαδιά τους χτυπώντας τη γη σε μια παρωδία χαιρετισμού. Μπροστά, το Σάιρ, εκείνη η αλαζονική πράσινη χοιρινή κοιλιά, γελάει με μια χαρά που δεν πίστευα.

Εγώ, ο Φρόντο Μπάγκινς, ο φορέας του... α, άστο!

Βάδισα βαριά μέσα από το μονοπάτι, σε μια στενή σήραγγα από αγκάθια, τα καλάμια τους τυλιγμένα σαν το ακτένιστο μουστάκι κάποιου αρχαίου σκαντζόχοιρου που έδειχνε τις αγκαθωτές του ακίδες. Οι αιχμές τους έτρωγαν τους αστραγάλους μου, μια σχίδα άρπαξε το παλτό μου και ένα κουμπί εκτοξεύτηκε σαν πυροτέχνημα.

Η λάσπη στριφογυρίζει κάτω από τα πόδια, κάθε βήμα γεννάει μια νέα ρυτίδα βρωμιάς. Τα κατσικίσια πέλματά μου, κάποτε περήφανα, τώρα καλυμμένα με λάσπη στο χρώμα μιας σάπιας λεμονόκαραμέλας, με τραβούσαν κάτω διαμαρτυρόμενα σαν να συνωμοτούσε η ίδια η γη να με χρεώνει ανά βήμα. Κλωτσάω τη βρύα-λάσπη, και η λέρα τώρα γλιστράει και τρίζει σαν δύο ατιμασμένοι ρήτορες.

Πυκνή σαν το βρεγμένο ποδιά μιας μπαργούμαν, η ομίχλη κυλάει μέσα. Όχι η συνηθισμένη υγρή χνουδωτή ομίχλη του Σάιρ αλλά ένα υγρό, κρεατώδες πράγμα που κολλάει στο λαιμό μου και ψιθυρίζει με τους νεκρούς τόνους ενός πνιγμένου εκκλησιαστικού οργανίστα. Ένα δέντρο είχε κουτσάνει μέσα στην ομίχλη, τα φύλλα του τώρα φτερουγίζοντας σαν χίλιες ξεφτισμένες γλώσσες.

Ένας βάτραχος καθισμένος σ' έναν ανάποδα γυρισμένο πέτρινο λουτρό πουλιών, φώναζε με την εξουσία ενός προφήτη, κοροϊδεύοντας τη δίψα μου. Ο λαιμός του ένα γυαλιστερό ροζ μπαλόνι, η φωνή του ένα κρώξιμο που παλλόταν, "Βροχή Βροχή!" Άνοιξα τα μάτια. Προς τ' άστρα, ήταν εκείνο το πουλί εκεί δύο καρδιοχτύπια πριν; Ορκίζομαι πως όχι.

Το μονοπάτι μπροστά διχάζεται, αλλά και οι δύο σχισμές οδηγούν στην ίδια κατασκευή. Γεννημένη από την ομίχλη, μια γέφυρα από κομμένα έντερα, που εκτείνεται πάνω από ένα χάσμα όπου η γη χάσκει σαν το στόμα ενός λαίμαργου. Και οι δύο πανομοιότυπες. Και οι δύο μπλεγμένες σε σάπια φύλλα. Διάλεξα αριστερά ή δεξιά; Η απόφαση πάρθηκε από το πόδι μου.

Τα νευρώδη σχοινιά της γέφυρας στέναζαν σαν να είχε καλεστεί κάποιο αρχαίο θηρίο, μόνο για να πεθάνει εδώ προς όφελός μας. Κάθε κίνηση έβγαζε χυλόνερα. Οι κόμποι κάτω από τα πόδια μου έτριζαν, το είδος των ήχων που αντηχούν μέσα από τους τοίχους μοτέλ στις 3 τα ξημερώματα, όταν τα ελατήρια των κρεβατιών τραγουδούν τους σκουριασμένους ύμνους τους.

Στη μέση της διάβασης, πάτησα σε μια ακόμη σανίδα, ή αυτό που περνούσε για σανίδα, ένα μόνο κόκαλο από ένα ζώο, που ίσως να μην ήταν και το πιο έξυπνο να σφαγεί. Το κόκαλο υποχώρησε, έσπασε και το αριστερό μου πόδι βούλιαξε μέχρι τον αστράγαλο. Η άβυσσος άρπαξε την κνήμη μου με τον ενθουσιασμό μιας γιαγιάς που μόλις έμαθε ότι το εγγόνι της έρχεται για δείπνο.

Ένας σκόρος, μάλλον μεθυσμένος από ζυμωμένο νέκταρ, προσέκρουσε στο μέτωπό μου. Χτύπησα τις εναέριες ακροβατικές του, τα φτερά του φωνάζοντας "Έουτ! Έουτ!" με μια φωνή που θα μπορούσε να ανήκει μόνο σε έναν δυσαρεστημένο ξωτικό.

Ψηλάφησα το παλτό μου. Μέσα στην τσέπη μου, με τα δάχτυλα να ψάχνουν, βρήκα ένα δόντι δράκου, κρύο, οδοντωτό, και ένα μόνο κουμπί, αυτό που είχε εκτοξευτεί νωρίτερα. Το δόντι είχε σφηνώσει στη γλώττα της τσέπης. Έπρεπε να είναι αυτό που είχα κλέψει από έναν μπάρμαν στο Μπρι για ένα μπουκάλι ρούμι, αναμφίβολα.

Προσπάθησα να το τραβήξω έξω. Πεισματάρικο πράγμα! Αντιστάθηκε, πιασμένο στο ύφασμα, δοκιμάζοντας την υπομονή μου. Το έβγαλα αργά, αργά, αργά, σαν σπαθί. Τελικά, το δόντι βγήκε, κίτρινο και μοχθηρό.

Το σχοινί που έδενε τον αστράγαλό μου, παχύ σαν φίδι. Τοποθέτησα την άκρη του δοντιού κατά της τραχιάς υφής του κάνναβου, εκείνων των ινών πλεγμένων μαζί στην αλαζονεία τους για δύναμη, και πριόνιζα. Μπρος πίσω, το δόντι τρίβοντας, μασώντας, σχίζοντας ίνα προς ίνα.

Τελικά το σχοινί έσπασε. Η γέφυρα κάμφθηκε λίγο. Η άβυσσος από κάτω με κοίταζε με υπομονή, ξέροντας ότι η βαρύτητα ποτέ δεν ξεχνάει ένα ραντεβού.

Το πόδι μου τραβήχτηκε ελεύθερο, ρουφήχτηκε από το χάσμα του κόκαλου. Σκοντάφτηκα μπροστά, κρατήθηκα στα υπόλοιπα σχοινιά της γέφυρας, εκείνα τα νεύρα που ακόμα κρατιόνταν από το σκοπό τους.

Το σχοινί που έκοψα, κρεμόταν τώρα χαλαρό, αιωρούμενο σαν ένα δάχτυλο που κουνιέται σε δυσαρέσκεια.

Μπροστά, η ομίχλη άρχισε να ξεφλουδίζεται σε λεπτά, τρεμάμενα στρώματα, αποκαλύπτοντας την απέναντι όχθη: μια κηλίδα γης επίπεδη σαν ένα φύλλο χαρτί και χλωρή σαν το χαμόγελο μιας μάγισσας.

Ποιες λέξεις θα ταίριαζαν καλύτερα σε μια ομίχλη τελικά, αν όχι μια δημοκρατία σκιών;

Πίσω μου, η γέφυρα έσπασε στον αέρα σαν να είχε κουραστεί να είναι γέφυρα και, σε μια τελική πράξη ανταρσίας, διπλώθηκε σε χάρτινο αεροπλανάκι και εκτοξεύτηκε στο χασμουρητό λαιμό του χάσματος. Πέτρες τρίβοντας τα ούλα τους στα πέφτοντα συντρίμμια.

Στεκόμουν στην απέναντι όχθη, ακόμα συνδεδεμένος με τα άκρα μου, ακόμα πλήρως ντυμένος, εκτός από το χαμένο κουμπί.

Μια φωλιά κοράκων καθισμένων μπροστά, πρόσεξε τη γέφυρα να καταρρέει, και όλο το σμήνος ξέσπασε. Τα ράμφη τους άνοιξαν μονομιάς, κράζοντας όχι ένα οιωνό θανάτου αλλά μια μιμητική, ξυλοφωνική τριλιά της γέφυρας να διαλύεται σε μωσαϊκό από κλαδιά και κόκαλα.

Τα φτερά τους ούρλιαξαν και εκτοξεύτηκαν στον αέρα, αιωρήθηκαν εκεί μια στιγμή και βούτηξαν στην χασμουρητή μαύρη τραχεία, που τώρα γάργαρε τα απομεινάρια με την ευχαρίστηση ενός κανιβαλικού χυλού.

Το έδαφος εδώ, φαινόταν να βουίζει σιωπηλά. Η ομίχλη είχε διαλυθεί εντελώς. Ο αέρας ήταν καθαρός. Το φως ήταν πολύ έντονο.

** # Κεφάλαιο 1: Η Διάβαση της Γέφυρας

Τα δέντρα, αυτά τα λυγισμένα νεύρα από φλοιό, ανακατεύονταν στην όρασή μου, οι ρίζες τους ξύνοντας το χώμα, οι κορμοί έγερναν προς τα μέσα σαν το χαμόγελο μιας γοργόνας, τα στραβά κλαδιά τους χτυπούσαν τη γη σε μια παρωδία χαιρετισμού. Μπροστά, το Σάιρ, αυτή η αυθάδης πράσινη χοιρινή κοιλιά, γελούσε με ευθυμία που δεν πίστευα.

Εγώ, ο Φρόντο Μπάγκινς, ο φορέας του... α, δεν πειράζει!

Προχώρησα βαριά στο μονοπάτι, μέσα σε ένα στενό τούνελ από αγκάθια, τα κλαδιά τους στριφογυρισμένα σαν το αχτένιστο μουστάκι ενός αρχαίου σκαντζόχοιρου που τίναζε τις αγκαθωτές του ακίδες. Οι αιχμές τους έτρωγαν τους αστραγάλους μου, ένα αγκάθι άρπαξε το παλτό μου και ένα κουμπί σκάει σαν πυροτέχνημα.

Η λάσπη στριφογυρίζει κάτω από τα πόδια, κάθε βήμα γεννά μια νέα ρυτίδα από βρωμιά. Οι κατσικίσιες σόλες μου, κάποτε περήφανες, τώρα καλυμμένες με λάσπη στο χρώμα ενός σάπιου λεμονιού, με τραβούσαν κάτω σε διαμαρτυρίες σαν να συνωμοτούσε η ίδια η γη να με χρεώνει ανά βήμα. Κλωτσάω την ιλυώδη βρύα, και η λάσπη τώρα γλιστράει και τρίζει σαν δύο ατιμασμένοι ρήτορες.

Πυκνή σαν τη μουσκεμένη ποδιά μιας σερβιτόρας, η ομίχλη κυλάει μέσα. Όχι η συνηθισμένη υγρή χνούδα του Σάιρ αλλά ένα υγρό, σαρκώδες πράγμα που κολλάει στον λαιμό μου και ψιθυρίζει με τους νεκρούς τόνους ενός πνιγμένου εκκλησιάστη οργανίστα. Ένα δέντρο κούτσαινε μέσα στην ομίχλη, τα φύλλα του τώρα φτερουγίζουν σαν χίλιες ξεφτισμένες γλώσσες.

Ένας βάτραχος καθισμένος σε μια ανάποδη πέτρινη λουτρίδα πουλιών, φώναξε με την εξουσία ενός προφήτη, κοροϊδεύοντας τη δίψα μου. Ο λαιμός του ένα γυαλιστερό ροζ μπαλόνι, η φωνή του ένα κοάξιμο που παλλόταν, "Βροχή! Βροχή!" Έβλεψα. Στ' αστέρια, μήπως αυτό το πουλί ήταν εκεί δύο χτυποκάρδια πριν; Ορκίζομαι πως όχι.

Το μονοπάτι μπροστά διχάζεται, αλλά και οι δύο σχισμές οδηγούν στην ίδια κατασκευή. Γεννημένη από την ομίχλη, μια γέφυρα από κομποδεμένα έντερα, περνώντας πάνω από ένα χάσμα όπου η γη χασμουρήθηκε σαν το στόμα ενός λαίμαργου. Και οι δύο πανομοιότυπες. Και οι δύο μπλεγμένες με σάπια φύλλα. Επέλεξα αριστερά ή δεξιά; Η απόφαση πάρθηκε από το πόδι μου.

Τα νευρώδη σχοινιά της γέφυρας έβγαζαν στεναγμούς σαν να είχε κληθεί κάποιο αρχαίο κτήνος, απλώς για να πεθάνει εδώ προς όφελός μας. Κάθε κίνηση έβγαζε ήχο. Οι κόμποι κάτω από τα πόδια μου έτριζαν, το είδος των ήχων που αντηχούν μέσα από τοίχους μοτέλ στις 3 το πρωί, όταν τα στρώματα τραγουδούν τους σκουριασμένους ύμνους τους.

Στη μέση της διάβασης, πάτησα σε άλλη μια σανίδα, ή αυτό που περνούσε για σανίδα, ένα μόνο κόκαλο από ένα ζώο, που ίσως να μην ήταν σοφό να το σφάξουν. Το κόκαλο υποχώρησε, έσπασε και το αριστερό μου πόδι βυθίστηκε μέχρι τον αστράγαλο. Η άβυσσος άρπαξε την κνήμη μου με τον ενθουσιασμό μιας γιαγιάς που μόλις έμαθε ότι το εγγόνι της έρχεται για δείπνο.

Ένας σκόρος, πιθανώς μεθυσμένος από ζυμωμένο νέκταρ, χτύπησε στο μέτωπό μου. Χτύπησα τα αεροβατικά του, τα φτερά του ούρλιαζαν "Γιούτ! Γιούτ!" με μια φωνή που θα μπορούσε να ανήκει μόνο σε έναν δυσαρεστημένο ξωτικό.

Ψηλάφησα το παλτό μου. Μέσα στην τσέπη μου, τα δάχτυλα ψάχνοντας, βρήκα ένα δόντι δράκου, κρύο, οδοντωτό, και ένα μόνο κουμπί, αυτό που σκάει πριν. Το δόντι είχε κολλήσει στη γλώττα της τσέπης. Έπρεπε να είναι αυτό που εξαπάτησα από έναν μπάρμαν στο Μπρι για ένα μπουκάλι ρούμι, χωρίς αμφιβολία.

Προσπάθησα να το τραβήξω έξω. Πεισματάρικο πράγμα! Αντιστάθηκε, πιασμένο στο ύφασμα, δοκιμάζοντας την υπομονή μου. Το τράβηξα αργά, αργά, αργά, σαν σπαθί. Τελικά, το δόντι βγήκε, κίτρινο και κακούργο.

Το σχοινί που έδενε τον αστράγαλό μου, χοντρό σαν φίδι. Τοποθέτησα την άκρη του δοντιού κόντρα στην τραχιά υφή του καννάβου, αυτές τις ίνες στριμμένες μαζί στην προσποίηση της δύναμης, και πρίονισα. Μπρος και πίσω, το δόντι τρίβοντας, μασώντας, σχίζοντας κλώνο με κλώνο.

Επιτέλους το σχοινί χώρισε. Η γέφυρα έκαμψε λίγο. Η άβυσσος από κάτω με κοίταζε με υπομονή, ξέροντας ότι η βαρύτητα δεν ξεχνά ποτέ ένα ραντεβού.

Το πόδι μου τραβήχτηκε ελεύθερο, απορροφήθηκε από το κενό του κόκαλου. Σκόνταψα μπροστά, πιάστηκα από τα υπόλοιπα σχοινιά της γέφυρας, αυτά τα νεύρα που ακόμα κρατούσαν τον σκοπό τους.

Το σχοινί που έκοψα, κρεμόταν τώρα χαλαρό, κουνιόταν σαν ένα δάχτυλο που κουνάει με αποδοκιμασία.

Μπροστά, η ομίχλη άρχισε να ξεφλουδίζει σε λεπτά, τρεμάμενα στρώματα, αποκαλύπτοντας την απέναντι όχθη: ένα κομμάτι γης επίπεδο σαν φύλλο περγαμηνής και χλωρό σαν το χλευαστικό χαμόγελο μιας μάγισσας.

Ποιες λέξεις θα ταίριαζαν καλύτερα σε μια ομίχλη τελικά, αν όχι μια δημοκρατία σκιών;

Πίσω μου, η γέφυρα έσπασε στον αέρα σαν να είχε βαρεθεί να είναι γέφυρα και, σε μια τελική πράξη ανταρσίας, διπλώθηκε σε χάρτινο αεροπλανάκι και εκτοξεύτηκε στον χασμωμένο λαιμό του χάσματος. Πέτρες τρίζανε τα ούλα τους στα πέφτοντα συντρίμμια.

Στεκόμουν στην απέναντι όχθη, ακόμα προσαρτημένος στα μέλη μου, ακόμα πλήρως ντυμένος, εκτός από το χαμένο κουμπί.

Μια φωλιά από κοράκια που κάθονταν μπροστά, προσέχησαν τη γέφυρα να καταρρέει, και όλο το σμήνος ξέσπασε. Τα ράμφη τους άνοιξαν ταυτόχρονα, κρώζοντας όχι οιωνό θανάτου αλλά μια μιμούμενη, ξυλοφωνική τριλλίδα της γέφυρας να ατομοποιείται σε μωσαϊκό από κλαδιά και κόκαλα.

Τα φτερά τους ούρλιαξαν και εκτοξεύτηκαν στον αέρα, αιωρήθηκαν εκεί για μια στιγμή και βούτηξαν στη χασμωμένη μαύρη τραχεία, που τώρα γαργάριζε τα υπολείμματα με την απόλαυση μιας κανιβαλιστικής σούπας.

Το έδαφος εδώ, φαινόταν να βουίζει ήσυχα. Η ομίχλη είχε ξεκαθαρίσει εντελώς. Ο αέρας ήταν καθαρός. Το φως ήταν πολύ λαμπερό.
** Κεφάλαιο 2: Το σπίτι του Σαμ**

Πλησίαζα το χωριό των χόμπιτ Γκλίμερρουτ που κρεμόταν στην πλαγιά του λόφου. Τα σπίτια ήταν σωροί χώματος, φουσκωμένες κοιλιές έγκυες με καπνό πίπας, οι πόρτες τους στρογγυλές, ξύλο σκασμένο και σαρακωμένο. Παράθυρα σαν μάτια σκαμμένα, και οι καμινάδες λυγισμένες στο λαιμό, στραγγαλισμένες από τον δικό τους καπνό.

Το μονοπάτι προς το σπίτι του Σαμ στριφογυρίζει καλλιγραφικά, σαν να γράφει ξόρκια το ίδιο το έδαφος. Πέτρινα σκαλοπάτια λειασμένα από δεκαετίες χομπιτίσια πόδια, το καθένα διαφορετικού ύψους σαν ο λιθοξόος να ήταν μεθυσμένος, απολυμένος, και μετά ξαναπροσληφθείς από λύπηση.

«Σαμ!» φώναξα, η φωνή μου να σπάει στους τοίχους. Καμία απάντηση. Η πόρτα του είχε σιδερένιο χερούλι, σκουριασμένο στο χρώμα του στεγνωμένου αίματος. Έπιασα το χερούλι. Μου έκαψε την παλάμη, κρύο σαν χέρι χήρας σε χειραψία θανάτου. Έσπρωξα την πόρτα, ούρλιαξαν οι μεντεσέδες της.

Από κάτω, από κάπου κάτω από τις σανίδες, ήρθε ένας ήχος. «Το κελάρι. Όπου φυτρώνουν τα καλά πράγματα» μουρμούρισα στον εαυτό μου.

Κατέβηκα τη σκάλα, ένα τρυπάνι βιδωμένο στα έγκατα της γης, που σπιράλιζε προς τα κάτω, κάθε σκαλοπάτι πιο στενό από το προηγούμενο.

Βαρέλια στοιβαγμένα στους τοίχους, τρία σε ύψος, το ξύλο τους φουσκωμένο με ό,τι υγρά κρατούσαν αιχμάλωτα.

Ο Σαμ ήταν εκεί. Το πάτωμα, πατημένο χώμα, είχε αποικιστεί από μια αποικία μανιταριών, τα καπέλα τους ανοιγμένα προς όλες τις κατευθύνσεις, τα κοτσάνια τους να ερπύζουν στο έδαφος, σε μοτίβα που υποδήλωναν είτε μεγάλη ευφυΐα είτε μεγάλη τρέλα.

«Φρόντο! Φρόντο Μπάγκινς, εσύ μισοσάπιο πράσο!» βροντοφώναξε ο Σαμ.

«Θεέ μου!» κράξαμε, ενώ ανέβαινε, η σκάλα να τρίζει σε τόνο που μόνο γάτες μπορούσαν να ακούσουν.

Βγήκαμε από το σκοτάδι και πήγαμε στο τραπέζι, αυτή την αρχαία ξύλινη πλάκα που κυριαρχούσε στο κύριο δωμάτιο σαν βωμός. Ο Σαμ σύρθηκε στην κουζίνα του, ράφι πάνω σε ράφι με βάζα, το καθένα να περιέχει υγρά ή στερεά σε διάφορα στάδια. Διάλεξε ένα βάζο, μέσα ηλεκτρικό υγρό, κάτι που κουνιόταν όταν δεν έπρεπε να κουνιέται.

«Αυτό», είπε ο Σαμ, σκύβοντας μπροστά με την ένταση ενός ανθρώπου που μόλις ανακάλυψε ότι τα μανιτάρια μπορούν να είναι και καύσιμο και καύσιμο για προφητείες, «είναι τσάι μανιταριών». Τα γένια του, φρικιασμένα με σπορανγιοφόρους, έφτυναν σπόρους σαν μικρούς αλεξιπτωτιστές στο κενό.

Έχυσε. Το υγρό κυλούσε ιλυώδες από το βάζο στο φλιτζάνι, παχύ σαν μέλι, ατμός ανέβαινε, όχι ατμός, καπνός που κουβαλούσε μια οσμή που ήταν μισή χώμα, μισή θάνατος, μισή κάτι άλλο εντελώς, κάτι που έκανε τις τρίχες της μύτης μου να στριφογυρίσουν αυτοάμυνα.

Ο Σαμ έσπρωξε το φλιτζάνι απέναντι στο τραπέζι προς εμένα. Γλίστρησε μέσα από ένα στρώμα σκόνης, αφήνοντας ένα γλοιώδες ίχνος πίσω του.

«Ενισχύει τη γλωσσική ακρίβεια», είπα, ρουφώντας από το φλιτζάνι.

«Αυτή η λέξη δεν υπάρχει», απάντησε, το τσάι του να τσαλαβουτάει.

«Υπάρχει, σε μια γλώσσα που μόλις εφηύρα», είπα, «αλλά θα μπορούσε κάλλιστα να ανήκει στη Θρομβολική διάλεκτο, μια γλώσσα που μιλούν οι ψαράνθρωποι της Υφάλμυρης Θάλασσας».

«Το δαχτυλίδι μου δυσλειτουργεί τελευταία, Σαμ», είπα, αρπάζοντας το δαχτυλίδι ανάμεσα σε αντίχειρα και δείκτη σαν να ήταν αναμμένο κάρβουνο. «Τις τελευταίες τρεις μέρες, με κάνει να εξαφανίζομαι στην ταπετσαρία ενώ προσπαθώ να φάω πρωινό. Σκέψου το, ψωμί και μαρμελάδα, μισοφαγωμένα, και πουφ, δεν είμαι εκεί. Τα παστινάκια μου έμειναν κρεμασμένα στον αέρα, να ρωτάνε πού έφυγε ο αφεντικός τους». Χτύπησα το δαχτυλίδι στο τραπέζι. «Για ένα χρόνο φορούσα το δαχτυλίδι σαν δεύτερο δέρμα. Αλλά τώρα, είναι ιδιότροπο. Χθες, με άφησε να με δει ένα κοράκι, Σαμ! Ένα καταραμένο κορακοειδές που μου έκλεψε το καπέλο!»

Ο Σαμ σήκωσε το δαχτυλίδι, κοιτάζοντάς το όπως ένας χασάπης εξετάζει κρέας ύποπτο. Το γύρισε. Το κράτησε στο φως του κεριού. Η φλόγα λύγισε γύρω του.

«Φρόντο», είπε, «αυτό το πράγμα σου, είναι ηλεκτρονικό, σωστά; Έχει κυκλώματα. Μικροθαυματουργία. Πιθανόν να λειτουργεί με μικρούς δαίμονες φυλακισμένους σε πυρίτιο. Αυτοί οι δαίμονες γίνονται τεμπέληδες, όλο το σύστημα καταρρέει. Έχει σύρματα και μηχανισμούς που ούτε ξέρεις;»

«Μοιάζω σαν μηχανικός; Τι ξέρω εγώ από τεχνομαγικές μπούρδες;» φώναξα, χτυπώντας το δαχτυλίδι στο τραπέζι. Κύλισε σαν μεθυσμένο σκαθάρι. «Δεν είναι τοστιέρα, Σαμ. Είναι μια συσκευή από τη Μορντόρ. Έχεις ακουστά τη Μορντόρ; Φτιάχνουν μαγεία κατά παραγγελία για τύπους που θέλουν να εξαφανίζονται».

Έσκυψε, η αναπνοή του ξινή από το τσάι μανιταριών. «Μορντόρ; Δηλαδή, η Μορντόρ; Η κατασκευή μαύρης μαγείας;»

«Δηλαδή η μόνη εταιρεία που πουλάει πράγματα σε ανθρώπους που δεν θα κάνουν ερωτήσεις», είπα. «Η διαφήμιση υποσχόταν 'Αορατότητα Εγγυημένη'». Σήκωσα το δαχτυλίδι, το κράτησα στο φως του κεριού. «Ο πωλητής είχε εξαιρετικά δόντια. Πολύ πειστικά δόντια».

«Ίσως να πρέπει να τους τηλεφωνήσεις. Ίσως αυτό το γκρέμλιν σου χρειάζεται απλά αναβάθμιση λογισμικού. Πάρε την εταιρεία τηλέφωνο. Πες τους ότι το δαχτυλίδι σου είναι ελαττωματικό, ότι κάνει την εξαφάνισή σου ασύμμετρη».
** # Κεφάλαιο 2: Το Σπίτι του Σαμ

Πλησίασα το χωριό των χόμπιτ Λαμπρορρίζα που κρεμόταν στην πλαγιά του λόφου. Τα σπίτια, σωροί χώματος ήταν, φουσκωμένες κοιλιές έγκυες με καπνό από πίπα, οι πόρτες τους στρογγυλές, ξύλο ραγισμένο και σκαρφαλωμένο από σκαθάρια. Παράθυρα σαν μάτια σκαλισμένα, και οι ραχοκοκαλιές των καμινάδων λυγισμένες στο λαιμό, πνιγμένες από τον δικό τους καπνό.

Το μονοπάτι προς το σπίτι του Σαμ στριφογυρίζει καλλιγραφικά, σαν να γράφει μάγια το ίδιο το χώμα. Πέτρινα σκαλοπάτια είχαν γυαλιστήσει λεία από δεκαετίες ποδιών χόμπιτ, το καθένα διαφορετικού ύψους σαν ο λιθοξόος να ήταν μεθυσμένος, απολυμένος, και ύστερα ξαναπροσλημμένος από λύπηση.

«Σαμ!» φώναξα, η φωνή μου να σπάει στους τοίχους. Καμία απάντηση. Η πόρτα του είχε σιδερένιο χερούλι, σκουριασμένο στο χρώμα του πηγμένου αίματος. Άρπαξα το χερούλι. Έκαψε την παλάμη μου, παγωμένο σαν το χέρι χήρας σε χειραψία θανάτου. Έσπρωξα την πόρτα, τσίριξε στους μεντεσέδες της.

Από κάτω, από κάπου κάτω από τα μαδέρια, ήρθε ένας ήχος. «Το κελάρι. Όπου φυτρώνουν τα καλά πράγματα» μουρμούρισα στον εαυτό μου.

Κατέβηκα τη σκάλα, ένα τρυπάνι βιδωμένο στα έντερα της γης, που στριφογύριζε προς τα κάτω, κάθε σκαλί πιο στενό από το προηγούμενο.

Βαρέλια στοιχισμένα στους τοίχους, σωριασμένα τρία σε ύψος, το ξύλο τους φουσκωμένο με ό,τι υγρά φυλάκιζαν.

«Φρόντο! Φρόντο Μπάγκινς, μισοσάπιο πράσο!» η φωνή του Σαμ βροντοφώναξε.

«Θεέ μου!» κρώζει, ανεβαίνοντας, η σκάλα να τρίζει σε τόνο που μόνο γάτες άκουγαν.

Αναδύθηκαμε από το σκοτάδι και πήγαμε στο τραπέζι, εκείνη την αρχαία πλάκα ξύλου που δέσποζε στο κεντρικό δωμάτιο σαν βωμός. Ο Σαμ σέρθηκε προς την κουζίνα του, ράφι επάνω σε ράφι με βάζα, το καθένα περιέχοντας υγρά ή στερεά σε διάφορα στάδια. Διάλεξε ένα βάζο, κεχριμπαρένιο υγρό μέσα, κάτι που κινιόταν όταν δεν έπρεπε να κινείται.

«Αυτό,» είπε ο Σαμ, σκύβοντας μπροστά με την ένταση ανθρώπου που μόλις ανακάλυψε πως τα μανιτάρια μπορούν να είναι και καύσιμο και καύσιμο για προφητείες, «είναι τσάι μανιταριών». Τα γένια του, τσιμπλιασμένα με σποραγγιοφόρους, έφτυναν σπόρια σαν μικροσκοπικούς αλεξιπτωτιστές στο κενό.

Έχυσε. Το υγρό γλίστρησε από το βάζο στο φλιτζάνι, παχύ σαν μέλι, ατμός ανέβαινε, όχι ατμός, καπνός που κουβαλούσε μια μυρωδιά που ήταν μέρος χώμα, μέρος θάνατος, μέρος κάτι άλλο εντελώς, κάτι που έκανε τις τρίχες της μύτης μου να τυλιχτούν σε αυτοάμυνα.

Ο Σαμ έσπρωξε το φλιτζάνι στο τραπέζι προς το μέρος μου. Γλίστρησε μέσα από ένα στρώμα σκόνης, αφήνοντας μια γλοιώδη γραμμή πίσω του.

«Ενισχύει τη γλωσσική ακρολεξία,» είπα, πίνοντας μια γουλιά από το φλιτζάνι.

«Αυτή η λέξη δεν υπάρχει,» απάντησε, το τσάι του να σαλεύει τριγύρω.

«Υπάρχει, σε μια γλώσσα που μόλις επινόησα» είπα, «αλλά θα μπορούσε να ανήκει στη Θρομβολική διάλεκτο, μια γλώσσα που μιλιούνται από τους ψαράνθρωπους της Υποαλμυρής Θάλασσας.»

«Το δαχτυλίδι μου δυσλειτουργεί τελευταία, Σαμ,» είπα, αρπάζοντας το δαχτυλίδι ανάμεσα στον αντίχειρα και τον δείκτη σαν να ήταν καυτό κάρβουνο. «Τις τελευταίες τρεις μέρες, με κάνει να εξαφανίζομαι στην ταπετσαρία ενώ προσπαθώ να φάω πρωινό. Σκέψου το, φρυγανιά και μαρμελάδα, μισοφαγωμένα, και πουφ, δεν είμαι εκεί. Τα παστινάκια μου κρεμόντουσαν στον αέρα, ρωτώντας που πήγε ο αφέντης τους.» Χτύπησα το δαχτυλίδι στο τραπέζι. «Για έναν χρόνο φορούσα το δαχτυλίδι σαν δεύτερο δέρμα. Αλλά τώρα, είναι ιδιότροπο. Χτες, με άφησε να φανώ σε ένα κοράκι Σαμ! Ένα καταραμένο κοράκι που μου έκλεψε το καπέλο!»

Ο Σαμ πήρε το δαχτυλίδι, κοιτάζοντάς το όπως ένας χασάπης εξετάζει αμφίβολο κρέας. Το γύρισε. Το κράτησε στο φως του κεριού. Η φλόγα έκαμψε γύρω του.

«Φρόντο,» είπε, «αυτό το πράγμα σου, είναι ηλεκτρονικό, έτσι δεν είναι; Έχει κυκλώματα. Μικροθαυματολογία. Πιθανώς τρέχει με μικροσκοπικούς δαίμονες φυλακισμένους στο πυρίτιο. Αυτοί οι δαίμονες τεμπελιάζουν, όλο το σύστημα καταρρέει. Έχει καλώδια και γκάτζετ που ούτε που ξέρεις;»

«Μοιάζω σαν μηχανικός; Τι ξέρω εγώ από τεχνομαγική φλυαρία;» γύρισα απότομα, χτυπώντας το δαχτυλίδι στο τραπέζι. Κύλησε σαν μεθυσμένο σκαθάρι. «Δεν είναι τοστιέρα, Σαμ. Είναι ένα μηχανάκι από τη Μορδώρεια. Άκουσες ποτέ για τη Μορδώρεια; Φτιάχνουν προσαρμοσμένη μαγεία για άτομα που θέλουν να εξαφανίζονται.»

Έσκυψε κοντά, η αναπνοή του όξινη από το τσάι μανιταριών. «Μορδώρεια; Εννοείς, η Μορδώρεια; Μαυρομαγική κατασκευή;»

«Εννοώ τη μόνη εταιρεία που πουλάει πράγματα σε ανθρώπους που δεν θα κάνουν ερωτήσεις,» είπα. «Η διαφήμιση υποσχόταν 'Αοράτητα Εγγυημένη'.» Πήρα το δαχτυλίδι, το κράτησα στο φως του κεριού. «Ο πωλητής είχε εξαιρετικά δόντια. Πολύ πειστικά δόντια.»

«Ίσως πρέπει να τους τηλεφωνήσεις. Ίσως το γκρέμλιν σου απλά χρειάζεται ενημέρωση λογισμικού. Πάρε την εταιρεία τηλέφωνο. Πες τους ότι το δαχτυλίδι σου είναι ελαττωματικό, ότι κάνει την εξαφάνισή σου ασύμμετρη.»

** # Κεφάλαιο 3: Η εταιρεία Μόρντορ

Το τηλέφωνο, το περιστροφικό τέρας που ήταν, καθόταν στο τραπέζι του Σαμ, μαύρη βακελίτη, το καλώδιό του στριμμένο σαν έντερα, το ακουστικό βαρύ σαν ρόπαλο φτιαγμένο για κρανία.

Έκανα τον αριθμό. Κάθε νούμερο μια δέσμευση, το δάχτυλό μου να σφηνώνει στις περιστροφικές τρύπες, ο μηχανισμός να ανακατεύει τα σωθικά του, κάθε περιστροφή μια μικρή αιωνιότητα, κλικ-κλικ-κλικ, μια μηχανική πεπτική διαδικασία, ο τροχός να σέρνεται πίσω με την αντίσταση ενός απρόθυμου δημίου.

Χτύπημα. Χτύπημα. Χτύπημα.

«Καλώς ήρθατε στην Εξυπηρέτηση Πελατών της Μόρντορ, όπου το σκοτάδι σας είναι δουλειά μας», γλίστρησε μια γυναίκα εκπρόσωπος από την άλλη άκρη. Λεία σαν αρσενικό σε μέλι. «Το όνομά μου είναι Λουργκάθρα, αριθμό λογαριασμού, παρακαλώ.»

Καθάρισα το λαιμό μου, φλέμα κολλημένο εκεί σαν ένοικος που αρνείται έξωση. «Λογαριασμός εφτακόσια εβδομήντα τρία παύλα Β παύλα εννιά. Φρόντο Μπάγκινς, αγοραστής ενός δαχτυλιδιού αοράτου, μοντέλο Φασματοποιός 3000, σειριακός αριθμός...»

«Έχω το φάκελό σας, κύριε Μπάγκινς». Χαρτιά ανακατεύτηκαν από την πλευρά της, τραγανοί βίαιοι ήχοι, σαν κόκαλα που σπάνε με αποδοτικό τρόπο. «Πώς μπορώ να σκοτεινιάσω τη μέρα σας;»

«Το δαχτυλίδι μου δε λειτουργεί όπως πρέπει και έχει χειροτερέψει», της απάντησα, η φωνή μου να πέφτει σε σφύριγμα ψιθυριστό. «Χθες το πρωί, στη μέση της εξαφάνισης, κόλλησα στη μέση. Το πάνω μισό μου αόρατο, φευγάτο, εκκένωσε το χώρο, το κάτω μισό φανερό σαν χυλός. Τα πόδια μου έμειναν πίσω. Περπάτησαν στη σόμπα. Έβρασαν τσάι. Βαριόντουσαν. Ο κορμός μου πήγε για διακοπές στο μεταφυσικό βασίλειο, ενώ οι αστράγαλοί μου ανακάτευαν την κατσαρόλα!»

Σιωπή. Έπειτα καθάρισμα λαιμού, επαγγελματικός βήχας.

«Κύριε Μπάγκινς, επιτρέψτε μου να σας βάλω σε αναμονή για μια στιγμή...»

«Περίμενε, όχι...»

Μουσική επιτέθηκε στο ακουστικό κανάλι μου. Όχι μουσική, πραγματικά. Μελωδίες ανελκυστήρα συντεθειμένες σε κάτι που έμοιαζε με ακορντεόν φτιαγμένο από έντερα γάτας, βιολιά πνιγμένα στη μέση της νότας, άρπες που έκλαιγαν για έλεος.

Πίεσα το ακουστικό πιο δυνατά στο κρανίο μου. Πίσω από τη μουσική, φωνές. Η φωνή της, τώρα πνιχτή, χέρι σκεπασμένο πάνω από το μικρόφωνο, κάποιες πνιχτές φωνές διέρρεαν. Μια χορωδία από ορκικούς ουρλιασμούς και η φωνή της, μακρινή αλλά ακουστή, να απευθύνεται σε κάποιον:

«Γκρίσνακ! ΓΚΡΙΣΝΑΚ! Ο καινούργιος Ορκ, αυτός από την Παρτίδα Επτά, το πρόσωπό του κόλλησε στον πάτο του καζανιού, ναι, τον πάτο, δεν βλέπεις αυτός είναι ακόμα πιο άσχημος από τους υπόλοιπους; Τι εννοείς 'ποιος;' Αυτός που ουρλιάζει! Ναι, αυτός. Όχι, δεν μπορούμε να τον πουλήσουμε έτσι. Δε με νοιάζει αν κάποιος θέλει Ορκ με πρόσωπο στο πάτωμα, διάλυσέ τον σε αμινοξέα και ξεκίνα από την αρχή. Χρησιμοποίησε το μεγάλο δοχείο. Το βιομηχανικό δοχείο. Και για την αγάπη του Σκοτεινού Άρχοντα, ανακάτεψέ το αυτή τη φορά, μην το πετάξεις απλά μέσα και ελπίζεις». Ένας υγρός, κρεατώδης σπλούτς. «Α ναι. Ο μικρός Ογκ έχει μια δυσκολία». Μεταλλικό κροτάλισμα. Ένας άλλος χυλός. «Εκεί. Όλα καλύτερα. Σσσς. Καλό αγόρι».

Περίμενα. Ο Σαμ παρακολουθούσε, ρουφώντας το τσάι του από μανιτάρια.

Η μουσική κόπηκε. Η φωνή της επέστρεψε, λεία και πάλι.

«Ευχαριστώ για την αναμονή, κύριε Μπάγκινς. Απολογούμαι για την καθυστέρηση. Αντιμετωπίζουμε υψηλότερους όγκους κλήσεων από το συνηθισμένο, και επίσης το εργοστάσιο παραγωγής μας βιώνει αυτό που ονομάζουμε 'στιγμή αναδιάρθρωσης προϊόντων'.»

«Για το δαχτυλίδι μου...» άρχισα.

«Ναι. Το πρόβλημα της διχοτομημένης ορατότητάς σας. Έβγαλα τα δεδομένα του δαχτυλιδιού σας. Μοντέλο Φασματοποιός 3000, αγορασμένο πριν δεκαοκτώ μήνες, εγγύηση έχει λήξει...»

«Λήξει; Πλήρωσα καλά λεφτά για την παρατεταμένη εγγύηση! Ο πωλητής με τα εξαιρετικά δόντια, υποσχέθηκε...»

«Κύριε Μπάγκινς». Η φωνή της όξυνε, μαχαίρι τραβηγμένο από βελούδινο θηκάρι. «Η παρατεταμένη εγγύηση καλύπτει καταστροφική αποτυχία, όχι υποβάθμιση απόδοσης. Αυτό που βιώνετε ταξινομείται ως 'ανώμαλη φάση', η οποία εμπίπτει στη φυσιολογική φθορά».

«Φυσιολογική;» βρυχήθηκα, ο Σαμ να πηδάει στο μακρινό άκρο του τραπεζιού, το τσάι του από μανιτάρια να χύνεται.

«Κύριε, παρακαλώ χαμηλώστε τη φωνή σας. Κατανοώ την απογοήτευσή σας. Ωστόσο, τα αρχεία περιβάλλοντος εκτέλεσης του δαχτυλιδιού δεν είναι διαθέσιμα στον χρήστη. Τα εσωτερικά λειτουργήματα του δαχτυλιδιού σας, η διαγνωστική καταρράκτη, το θαυματουργικό ίχνος στοίβας, όλα ανήκουν στις Βιομηχανίες Μόρντορ. Αυτό είναι χαρακτηριστικό ασφαλείας για την αποτροπή αντίστροφης μηχανικής των ιδιόκτητων αλγορίθμων αοράτου μας».

Έσφιξα το ακουστικό, οι αρθρώσεις μου να ασπρίζουν, φαντάζοντας ότι ήταν το λαιμό της, όχι, όχι, όχι το λαιμό της, το λαιμό του πωλητή, αυτά τα εξαιρετικά δόντια να τρίζουν καθώς τον έπνιγα. «Χαρακτηριστικό ασφαλείας; Δεν μπορώ καν να δω τι πάει στραβά με το δικό μου δαχτυλίδι;»

«Σωστά. Τα αρχεία είναι κρυπτογραφημένα δεκαεφτά φορές, χρησιμοποιώντας δαιμονικά κρυπτογραφήματα που θα υγροποιούσαν τον εγκέφαλό σας αν προσπαθούσατε να τα διαβάσετε. Αυτό είναι για τη δική σας προστασία, κύριε Μπάγκινς».

«Τη δική μου προστασία». Γέλασα, ο ήχος να ξύνεται πάνω στο λαιμό μου σαν χαλίκι μέσα από αποχέτευση. «Είμαι μισοαόρατος ένα πρωινό Τρίτης, τρομάζοντας το γαλατά μέχρι καρδιακή προσβολή, και εσύ με προστατεύεις;»

«Κύριε, μπορώ να προγραμματίσω ένα διαγνωστικό ραντεβού. Η επόμενη διαθέσιμη θέση μας είναι...» χαρτιά να ανακατεύονται πάλι, αυτός ο ήχος σπασίματος κόκαλου, «...σε έξι εβδομάδες από τώρα, απόγευμα Τρίτης, μεταξύ δύο και έξι. Κάποιος θα έρθει να εξετάσει το δαχτυλίδι σας. Υπάρχει κόστος εξυπηρέτησης σαράντα χρυσών νομισμάτων, μη επιστρεπτέο, πληρωτέο εκ των προτέρων».

«Έξι εβδομάδες; Σαράντα χρυσά νομίσματα;»

«Εναλλακτικά», συνέχισε, φωνή λεία σαν ομολογία που εξάγεται υπό πίεση, «θα μπορούσατε να αγοράσετε το νέο μας μοντέλο, το Φασματοποιός 4000. Διαθέτει βελτιωμένη σταθερότητα φάσης, μειωμένη φασματική διαρροή, και δωρεάν αφαίρεση κατάρας για τον πρώτο μήνα».

«Θέλεις να ΑΓΟΡΑΣΩ ΑΛΛΟ ΔΑΧΤΥΛΙΔΙ;»

«Ο Φασματοποιός 3000 είναι ένα παλαιό προϊόν, κύριε Μπάγκινς. Δεν κατασκευάζουμε πια ανταλλακτικά. Σε κάποιο σημείο, η αναβάθμιση γίνεται πιο οικονομική από την επισκευή».
** # Κεφάλαιο 3: Η Εταιρεία Μόρντορ

Το τηλέφωνο, περιστροφικό τέρας που ήταν, καθόταν στο τραπέζι του Σαμ, μαύρο μπακελίτης, το καλώδιό του στριμμένο σαν έντερα, το ακουστικό βαρύ σαν ρόπαλο για κρανία.

Κάλεσα. Κάθε αριθμός μια δέσμευση, το δάχτυλό μου να σπρώχνει τις περιστροφικές τρύπες, ο μηχανισμός να αναδεύει τα έγκατά του, κάθε περιστροφή μια μικρή αιωνιότητα, κλικ κλικ κλικ, μια μηχανική διαδικασία πέψης, ο τροχός να γυρνάει πίσω με την αντίσταση ενός απρόθυμου δημίου.

Χτύπημα. Χτύπημα. Χτύπημα.

«Καλώς ήρθατε στην Εξυπηρέτηση Πελατών της Μόρντορ, όπου το σκοτάδι σας είναι η δουλειά μας» γλίστρησε μια γυναίκα εκπρόσωπος από την άλλη άκρη. Λεία σαν αρσενικό στο μέλι. «Με λένε Λουργκάθρα, τον αριθμό λογαριασμού, παρακαλώ.»

Καθάρισα το λαιμό μου, η σάλια κολλημένη εκεί σαν ένοικος που αρνείται την έξωση. «Λογαριασμός επτακόσια εβδομήντα τρία παύλα Β παύλα εννέα. Φρόντο Μπάγκινς, αγοραστής ενός δαχτυλιδιού αοράτου, μοντέλο Wraithmaker 3000, σειριακός αριθμός...»

«Έχω το φάκελό σας, κύριε Μπάγκινς.» Χαρτιά ανακατεύτηκαν από την πλευρά της, κοφτεροί βίαιοι ήχοι, σαν κόκαλα που σπάνε με αποτελεσματικό τρόπο. «Πώς μπορώ να σκοτεινιάσω τη μέρα σας;»

«Το δαχτυλίδι μου δεν λειτουργεί όπως πρέπει και χειροτερεύει,» της απάντησα, η φωνή μου να πέφτει σε ένα ψιθυριστό σύριγμα. «Χτες το πρωί, στη μέση της εξαφάνισης, κόλλησα στη μέση. Το πάνω μισό αόρατο, χαμένο, είχε φύγει από τον χώρο, το κάτω μισό φανερό σαν χυλός. Τα πόδια μου έμειναν πίσω. Πήγαν στην κουζίνα. Έβρασαν τσάι. Βαριόντουσαν. Ο κορμός μου πήγε διακοπές στο μεταφυσικό βασίλειο, ενώ οι αστράγαλοί μου ανακάτευαν τη χύτρα!»

Σιωπή. Μετά ένα καθάρισμα λαιμού, επαγγελματικός βήχας.

«Κύριε Μπάγκινς, επιτρέψτε μου να σας θέσω σε αναμονή για μια στιγμή...»

«Περίμενε, όχι...»

Μουσική επιτέθηκε στο αυτί μου. Όχι μουσική, πραγματικά. Μελωδίες ασανσέρ συνθεμένες σε κάτι που έμοιαζε με ακορντεόν φτιαγμένο από έντερα γάτας, βιολιά στραγγαλισμένα στη μέση της νότας, άρπες που έκλαιγαν για έλεος.

Πίεσα το ακουστικό πιο δυνατά στο κρανίο μου. Πίσω από τη μουσική, φωνές. Η φωνή της, τώρα σιγανή, χέρι που κάλυπτε το μικρόφωνο, μερικές φωνές διέρρεαν. Μια χορωδία ορκικών ουρλιαχτών και η φωνή της, μακριά αλλά ακουστή, να μιλάει σε κάποιον:

«Γκρισνάκχ! ΓΚΡΙΣΝΑΚΧ! Ο νέος Ορκ, αυτός από τη Σειρά Εφτά, το πρόσωπό του κόλλησε στον πάτο του καζανιού, ναι, στον πάτο, δεν βλέπεις αυτός είναι ακόμα πιο άσχημος από τους υπόλοιπους; Τι εννοείς 'ποιος;' Αυτός που ουρλιάζει! Ναι, αυτός. Όχι, δεν μπορούμε να τον πουλήσουμε έτσι. Δεν με νοιάζει αν κάποιος θέλει έναν Ορκ με πρόσωπο στο πάτωμα, αποσύνθεσέ τον σε αμινοξέα και ξεκίνα από την αρχή. Χρησιμοποίησε το μεγάλο δοχείο. Το βιομηχανικό δοχείο. Και για χάρη του Σκοτεινού Άρχοντα, ανακάτεψέ το αυτή τη φορά, μην το πετάξεις απλώς μέσα και να ελπίζεις.» Ένας υγρός, κρεατώδης ήχος. «Α ναι. Ο νεαρός Ογκ έχει μια δυσκολία.» Μεταλλικό κουδούνισμα. Άλλο σκουίξιμο. «Να. Όλα καλύτερα τώρα. Σσς. Καλό παιδί.»

Περίμενα. Ο Σαμ παρακολουθούσε, πίνοντας το τσάι του με μανιτάρια.

Η μουσική κόπηκε. Η φωνή της επέστρεψε, λεία ξανά.

«Ευχαριστώ που περιμένατε, κύριε Μπάγκινς. Ζητώ συγγνώμη για την καθυστέρηση. Αντιμετωπίζουμε μεγαλύτερους όγκους κλήσεων από το συνηθισμένο, και επίσης το εργοστάσιό μας βιώνει αυτό που ονομάζουμε 'στιγμή αναδιάρθρωσης προϊόντων'.»

«Για το δαχτυλίδι μου...» άρχισα.

«Ναι. Το πρόβλημα με την κομμένη ορατότητά σας. Τράβηξα τα δεδομένα του δαχτυλιδιού σας. Μοντέλο Wraithmaker 3000, αγορασμένο πριν δεκαοκτώ μήνες, εγγύηση έχει λήξει...»

«Λήξει; Πλήρωσα καλά χρήματα για την εκτεταμένη εγγύηση! Ο πωλητής με τα άριστα δόντια, υποσχέθηκε...»

«Κύριε Μπάγκινς.» Η φωνή της αιχμηρύνθηκε, μαχαίρι τραβηγμένο από βελούδινο θηκάρι. «Η εκτεταμένη εγγύηση καλύπτει καταστροφική αποτυχία, όχι υποβάθμιση απόδοσης. Αυτό που βιώνετε ταξινομείται ως 'ανώμαλη φασματική μετάβαση', που εμπίπτει στη φυσιολογική φθορά.»

«Φυσιολογική;» βρυχήθηκα, ο Σαμ να αναπηδά στην άλλη άκρη του τραπεζιού, το τσάι του με μανιτάρια να χύνεται.

«Κύριε, παρακαλώ χαμηλώστε τη φωνή σας. Καταλαβαίνω την απογοήτευσή σας. Ωστόσο, τα αρχεία περιβάλλοντος εκτέλεσης του δαχτυλιδιού δεν είναι διαθέσιμα στον χρήστη. Τα εσωτερικά έργα του δαχτυλιδιού σας, η διαγνωστική καταρράκτης, το θαυματουργικό στοίβα ίχνους, όλα ανήκουν στις Βιομηχανίες Μόρντορ. Αυτό είναι χαρακτηριστικό ασφαλείας για την αποτροπή αντίστροφης μηχανολογίας των ιδιόκτητων αλγορίθμων αοράτου μας.»

Έσφιξα το ακουστικό, οι αρθρώσεις μου να ασπρίζουν, φαντάζοντας ότι ήταν ο λαιμός της, όχι, όχι, όχι ο λαιμός της, ο λαιμός του πωλητή, εκείνα τα άριστα δόντια να τρίζουν καθώς τον έπνιγα. «Χαρακτηριστικό ασφαλείας; Δεν μπορώ καν να δω τι συμβαίνει με το δικό μου δαχτυλίδι;»

«Σωστά. Τα αρχεία είναι κρυπτογραφημένα δεκαεπτά φορές, χρησιμοποιώντας δαιμονικούς κώδικες που θα υγροποιούσαν τον εγκέφαλό σας αν προσπαθούσατε να τα διαβάσετε. Αυτό είναι για την προστασία σας, κύριε Μπάγκινς.»

«Την προστασία μου.» Γέλασα, ο ήχος να ξύνεται στο λαιμό μου σαν χαλίκι μέσα από υδρορροή. «Είμαι μισοαόρατος ένα Τρίτη πρωί, τρομάζοντας το γαλατά μέχρι την καρδιακή προσβολή, και εσύ με προστατεύεις;»

«Κύριε, μπορώ να προγραμματίσω ένα ραντεβού διάγνωσης. Η επόμενη διαθέσιμη χρονοθυρίδα μας είναι...» χαρτιά να ανακατεύονται πάλι, αυτός ο ήχος σπασμένων κοκάλων, «...έξι εβδομάδες από τώρα, Τρίτη απόγευμα, μεταξύ των ωρών δύο και έξι. Κάποιος θα έρθει να εξετάσει το δαχτυλίδι σας. Υπάρχει χρέωση επισκευής σαράντα χρυσών νομισμάτων, μη επιστρεπτέα, πληρωτέα εκ των προτέρων.»

«Έξι εβδομάδες; Σαράντα χρυσά νομίσματα;»

«Εναλλακτικά,» συνέχισε, η φωνή λεία σαν ομολογία εξαναγκασμένη με βία, «θα μπορούσατε να αγοράσετε το νέο μας μοντέλο, το Wraithmaker 4000. Διαθέτει βελτιωμένη σταθερότητα φάσης, μειωμένη φασματική διαρροή, και δωρεάν αφαίρεση κατάρας για τον πρώτο μήνα.»

«Θέλεις να ΑΓΟΡΑΣΩ ΑΛΛΟ ΔΑΧΤΥΛΙΔΙ;»

«Το Wraithmaker 3000 είναι ένα προϊόν παλαιού τύπου, κύριε Μπάγκινς. Δεν κατασκευάζουμε πια ανταλλακτικά. Σε κάποιο σημείο, η αναβάθμιση γίνεται πιο οικονομική από την επισκευή.»
** # Κεφάλαιο 4: Ο Σάουρον, Διευθύνων Σύμβουλος της Mordor

«Προωθήστε με», γρύλισα στο ακουστικό. «Στον προϊστάμενό σας. Τώρα. Αυτή τη στιγμή».

Σιωπή, βαριά από το βάρος χιλίων γραφειοκρατικών αμαρτιών.

«Κύριε Μπάγκινς...»

«Προωθήστε. Με».

Ένας στεναγμός διέρρευσε από τη γραμμή, σαν αέρας που ξεφεύγει από το τελευταίο ξεφύσημα ενός πτώματος. «Μια στιγμή παρακαλώ».

«Εδώ Σάουρον. Διευθύνων Σύμβουλος, Βιομηχανίες Μόρντορ».

«Σάουρον. Ο Σάουρον; Το Μάτι της φλόγας, ο σφυρηλάτης των...»

«Ναι ναι ναι, όλα πολύ κινηματογραφικά, η ομάδα branding μου ξεπέρασε τον εαυτό της εκείνο το τρίμηνο, μπόνους για όλους, σιντριβάνια σαμπάνιας και τα λοιπά και τα λοιπά». Η φωνή του κύλησε σαν βράχοι κάτω από βουνό. «Τώρα όμως. Το δαχτυλίδι σου. Το Wraithmaker 3000. Σειριακός αριθμός χαραγμένος στις φωτιές του Όρους Doom, ψυγμένος στο αίμα προδομένων σιδηρουργών. Τι δυσλειτουργεί;»

«Χθες τα πόδια μου έφτιαχναν τσάι ενώ ο κορμός μου εξερευνούσε το αστρικό επίπεδο. Την προηγούμενη μέρα, φτέρνισα και το κεφάλι μου εξαφανίστηκε αλλά το σώμα μου έμεινε, περπατώντας σε τοίχους σαν αποκεφαλισμένη κότα, συγκρουόμενο με τα έπιπλα, τρομοκρατώντας τους γείτονες». Ψέλλισα.

«Χμμ». Ένας βρόμος, ηφαιστειακός, ηπειρωτική πλάκα που αποφασίζει αν θα σχιστεί. «Κλασική φθορά firmware. Οι δαίμονες που τροφοδοτούν τον κεντρικό επεξεργαστή του δαχτυλιδιού σου, μικροί μπάσταρδοι που είναι, τεμπελιάζουν. Συμβαίνει. Η περίπτωσή σου δεν είναι μοναδική. Έχουμε πελάτες που εξαφανίζονται τρεις τρεις. Πελάτες που ξυπνούν ανάποδα, ή ανάποδα από μέσα προς τα έξω, ή απλά επίπεδοι σαν τηγανίτες. Ατυχές αλλά αναπόφευκτο».

«Αναπόφευκτο;» ούρλιαξα, το φλιτζάνι του Σαμ έτρεμε στο πιατάκι, τα μανιτάρια στο κελάρι από κάτω πιθανώς μάζευαν. «Αναπόφευκτο; Πλήρωσα καλό χρυσάφι γι' αυτό το δαχτυλίδι! Ο πωλητής, με εκείνα τα δόντια του, υποσχέθηκε...»

«Οι πωλητές υπόσχονται πολλά πράγματα, κύριε Μπάγκινς». Η φωνή του Σάουρον κύλησε από τη γραμμή, μέλι αναμεμειγμένο με τριμμένο γυαλί. «Υπόσχονται αιωνιότητα. Υπόσχονται τελειότητα. Υπόσχονται, αγόρασε μια φορά, έχε μαγεία για πάντα, που, ας είμαστε ειλικρινείς, στη δική σου περίπτωση ήταν πιθανώς το κύριο επιχείρημα πώλησης, δεν ήταν;»

«Αλλά ρωτάω: Πώς υποτίθεται ότι πρέπει να το φτιάξω, αν δεν μπορώ να δω πώς δουλεύει, αν δεν μπορώ να διαγνώσω το δικό μου κόσμημα;» Βρυχήθηκα, πιέζοντας το ακουστικό τόσο σφιχτά στο κρανίο μου που πιθανώς θα είχα κυκλικό μελάνιασμα αύριο. «Αν τα εντόσθια αυτού του πράγματος ανήκουν στις Βιομηχανίες Μόρντορ, τότε ποιος το κατέχει; Εγώ; Ή εσύ;»

Το γέλιο του Σάουρον εξερράγη, όχι χαρά αλλά κατάκτηση, ένας ήχος που μου θύμισε στρατιές να βαδίζουν μέσα από φλεγόμενα χωριά, κοράκια να τρώνε πτώματα πεδίων μάχης, σημαίες νίκης καρφωμένες σε κρανία ηττημένων. «Το κατέχεις, Φρόντο Μπάγκινς; Ή απλά το διαθέτεις;»

«Αυτό, αυτό είναι το ίδιο πράγμα!»

«Αγόρασες το δαχτυλίδι, ναι;» Ο Σάουρον σφύριξε, «Δεν καταλαβαίνεις τη φύση της ιδιοκτησίας στη σύγχρονη εποχή. Αγόρασες το δαχτυλίδι, ναι; Ο χρυσός άλλαξε χέρια, συμβόλαιο υπογράφηκε, ίσως με αίμα, ίσως με μελάνι, οι λογistές δεν προσδιορίζουν. Κατέχεις το φυσικό αντικείμενο, τον μεταλλικό κρίκο που στρεβλώνει τη διαστατική σταθερότητα των παντελονιών σου. Αυτό είναι δικό σου».

«Με άδεια χρήσης», επανέλαβα.

«Αλλά!» Η λέξη εξερράγη στη γραμμή, θραύσματα συλλαβών, ο Σαμ έσκυψε σαν να ερχόταν πυροβολικό. «Το λογισμικό. Τα πρωτόκολλα αοράτησης. Η δαιμονική αρχιτεκτονική που τροφοδοτεί την εξαφάνισή σου—αυτό, κύριε Μπάγκινς, το έχεις με άδεια χρήσης. Επ' αόριστον, ναι, για τη διάρκεια της φυσικής σου ζωής και λίγο παραπέρα, αλλά με άδεια χρήσης παρ' όλα αυτά. Κατέχεις το δαχτυλίδι. Εμείς κατέχουμε τη μαγεία μέσα σε αυτό».

«Και αυτά τα αρχεία καταγραφής, η διαγνωστική καταρράκτη, το θαυματουργικό ίχνος στοίβας; Εσύ, Φρόντο Μπάγκινς, χόμπιτ πολίτης, θέλεις να κοιτάξεις μέσα στα εντόσθια ιδιόκτητης τεχνολογίας χιλιετιών ανάπτυξης; Τεχνολογίας που κόστισε δισεκατομμύρια σε έρευνα, σε κυριολεκτική θυσία, σε αίμα χυμένο μετρημένο από τον ωκεανό;»

«Το δαχτυλίδι παραμένει δικό σου, κύριε Μπάγκινς. Η αοράτηση, όμως, εκείνη απλά τη δανείζουμε. Επ' αόριστον, ναι, ακόμη και διηνεκώς, αλλά τη δανείζουμε. Έχεις άδεια. Αμετάκλητη, μη μεταβιβάσιμη, δεσμευτική μέχρι θανάτου και μετά. Αν παραβιάσεις τους όρους χρήσης, αντιστρέψεις τα ξόρκια, μοιραστείς τις επωδές, προσπαθήσεις να σπάσεις την κατάρα, διατηρούμε το δικαίωμα να απενεργοποιήσουμε εξ αποστάσεως τις λειτουργίες με άδεια χρήσης. Θα μείνεις με έναν πολύ ακριβό, πολύ άχρηστο κύκλο μετάλλου».

«Είναι αυτό νόμιμο;»

«Απολύτως νόμιμο», γουργούρισε ο Σάουρον, γάτα ικανοποιημένη μετά την κατανάλωση καναρινιού. «Ρήτρα δεκαεπτά, υποενότητα Β', παράγραφος εννέα. 'Ο χρήστης αναγνωρίζει ότι η λειτουργικότητα αοράτησης αποτελεί πνευματική ιδιοκτησία με άδεια χρήσης και παραμένει αποκλειστική ιδιοκτησία των Βιομηχανιών Μόρντορ διηνεκώς συν εβδομήντα χρόνια, όποιο έρθει τελευταίο.' Το υπέγραψες αυτό, κύριε Μπάγκινς. Η υπογραφή σου βρίσκεται στο θησαυροφυλάκιό μας, διατηρημένη σε κεχριμπάρι, φρουρούμενη από Μπάλρογκ».

«Αν παραβιάσεις τους όρους χρήσης, αντιστρέψεις τα ξόρκια, μοιραστείς τις επωδές, προσπαθήσεις να σπάσεις την κατάρα, αναρτήσεις τον πηγαίο κώδικα σε δημόσια φόρουμ για άλλους δυσαρεστημένους, διατηρούμε το δικαίωμα, κύριε Μπάγκινς, να απενεργοποιήσουμε εξ αποστάσεως τις λειτουργίες με άδεια χρήσης».

«Μπορείτε να το κλείσετε;»

«Με μια σκέψη. Με ένα υπόμνημα. Με ένα τικ σε φόρμα που επεξεργάζεται το Νομικό μας Τμήμα, Τρίτος Όροφος, Δυτική Πτέρυγα, η Κάρολ τα χειρίζεται αυτά, υπέροχη γυναίκα, φτιάχνει εξαιρετικά scones για τα πάρτι του γραφείου. Ένα τικ, κύριε Μπάγκινς, και το δαχτυλίδι σου γίνεται κόσμημα. Μοντέρνο, ίσως. Λαμπερό, σίγουρα. Λειτουργικό;» Σταμάτησε, αφήνοντας τη λέξη να κρέμεται σαν θηλιά. «Όχι».

«Καταλαβαινόμαστε, κύριε Μπάγκινς;»

Έγνεψα, συνειδητοποίησα ότι δεν μπορούσε να με δει, είπα βραχνά, «Ναι».

«Υπέροχα. Ευχαριστούμε που επιλέξατε τις Βιομηχανίες Μόρντορ, όπου το σκοτάδι σας είναι η δουλειά μας. Να έχετε μια μέρα».

Κλικ.

Η γραμμή πέθανε.

«Φρόντο», είπε απαλά ο Σαμ, «νομίζω χρειάζεσαι περισσότερο τσάι μανιταριών».

Έγνεψα. Τα λόγια με είχαν εγκαταλείψει. Η λογική είχε φύγει ουρλιάζοντας.

Σε έναν πύργο από μαύρη πέτρα και υπολογιστικά φύλλα, ο Σάουρον επέστρεψε στη γραφειοκρατία του, άλλη μια ψυχή δεμένη όχι από κατάρες αλλά από συμβόλαια, πολύ πιο μόνιμα, πολύ πιο σκληρά.

Το ακουστικό καθόταν βαρύ στο χέρι μου. Από το παράθυρο, ένα κοράκι προσγειώθηκε, έγειρε το κεφάλι του, κρίνοντάς με με μάτια που είχαν δει αυτή τη συνομιλία να ξετυλίγεται χίλιες φορές πριν, σε χίλια διαφορετικά σπίτια, με χίλιους διαφορετικούς ηλίθιους να κρατούν τηλέφωνα και να συνειδητοποιούν πολύ αργά ότι τους είχαν πουλήσει φιδίσιο λάδι από έναν άνθρωπο με όμορφα δόντια. Τόσο όμορφα δόντια!

Σιωπή, βαριά με το βάρος χίλιων γραφειοκρατικών αμαρτιών.

«Κύριε Μπάγκινς...»

«Προωθήστε. Με.»

Ένα αναστέναγμα διέρρευσε από τη γραμμή, αέρας που ξεφεύγει από το τελευταίο ξεφούσκωμα ενός πτώματος. «Μία στιγμή παρακαλώ.»

«Εδώ Σάουρον. Διευθύνων Σύμβουλος, Βιομηχανίες Μόρντορ.»

«Σάουρον. Ο Σάουρον; Μάτι της φλόγας, σιδηρουργός των...»

«Μμμ.» Ένας βρυχηθμός, ηφαιστειακός, ηπειρωτική πλάκα που αποφασίζει αν θα σχιστεί. «Κλασική φθορά λογισμικού.

«Αυτό, αυτό είναι το ίδιο πράγμα!»

«Αγόρασες το δαχτυλίδι, έτσι;» Ο Σάουρον έβγαλε έναν ήχο, «Παρεξηγείς τη φύση της ιδιοκτησίας στη σύγχρονη εποχή.

'Ο χρήστης αναγνωρίζει ότι η λειτουργικότητα αοράτησης συνιστά πνευματική ιδιοκτησία με άδεια χρήσης και παραμένει αποκλειστική ιδιοκτησία των Βιομηχανιών Μόρντορ επ' αόριστον συν εβδομήντα έτη, όποιο έρθει τελευταίο.' Υπέγραψες αυτό, κύριε Μπάγκινς. Η υπογραφή σου βρίσκεται στο θησαυροφυλάκιό μας, διατηρημένη σε κεχριμπάρι, φυλασσόμενη από Μπάλρογκ.»

«Αν παραβιάσεις τους όρους χρήσης, αντιστρέψεις τα ξόρκια, μοιραστείς τις επωδές, προσπαθήσεις να σπάσεις την κατάρα, δημοσιεύσεις τον πηγαίο κώδικα σε δημόσια φόρουμ για άλλους δυσαρεστημένους, διατηρούμε το δικαίωμα, κύριε Μπάγκινς, να απενεργοποιήσουμε εξ αποστάσεως τα χαρακτηριστικά με άδεια χρήσης.»

«Μπορείτε να το κλείσετε;»

«Με μία σκέψη. Με ένα υπόμνημα. Με ένα τικ σε μια φόρμα που επεξεργάζεται το Νομικό μας Τμήμα, Τρίτος Όροφος, Δυτική Πτέρυγα, η Κάρολ χειρίζεται αυτά, υπέροχη γυναίκα, φτιάχνει εξαιρετικά σκονς για τα πάρτι του γραφείου. Ένα τικ, κύριε Μπάγκινς, και το δαχτυλίδι σου γίνεται κόσμημα. Μοδάτο, ίσως. Λαμπερό, σίγουρα. Λειτουργικό;» Σταμάτησε, αφήνοντας τη λέξη να κρέμεται σαν θηλιά. «Όχι.»

«Καταλαβαινόμαστε, κύριε Μπάγκινς;»

Έγνεψα, συνειδητοποίησα ότι δεν μπορούσε να δει, βράχνιασα, «Ναι.»

«Υπέροχα. Ευχαριστούμε που επιλέξατε τις Βιομηχανίες Μόρντορ, όπου το σκοτάδι σας είναι η δουλειά μας. Καλή σας μέρα.»

Κλικ.

Η γραμμή έπεσε.

«Φρόντο», είπε απαλά ο Σαμ, «νομίζω χρειάζεσαι περισσότερο τσάι μανιταριών.»

Έγνεψα. Τα λόγια με είχαν εγκαταλείψει. Η λογική είχε φύγει ουρλιάζοντας.

Σε έναν πύργο από μαύρη πέτρα και υπολογιστικά φύλλα, ο Σάουρον επέστρεψε στα χαρτιά του, μία ακόμα ψυχή δεμένη όχι με κατάρες αλλά με συμβόλαια, πολύ πιο μόνιμα, πολύ πιο σκληρά.

Το ακουστικό καθόταν βαρύ στο χέρι μου. Από το παράθυρο, ένα κοράκι προσγειώθηκε, έγειρε το κεφάλι του, κρίνοντάς με με μάτια που είχαν δει αυτή τη συνομιλία να διαδραματίζεται χίλιες φορές πριν, σε χίλια διαφορετικά σπίτια, με χίλιους διαφορετικούς κορόιδους να κρατούν τηλέφωνα και να συνειδητοποιούν πολύ αργά ότι τους είχαν πουλήσει φίδι από άνθρωπο με όμορφα δόντια. Τόσο όμορφα δόντια!

** # Κεφάλαιο 5: Ο Γκάνταλφ και το άλογό του

Το παράθυρο, λερωμένο πράγμα που ήταν, μου έδειξε κίνηση, και ο κρότος οπλών σε χαλίκι ανήγγειλε μια μορφή να πλησιάζει.

Ένα άλογο, λευκό, μονόφθαλμο, ήρθε καλπάζοντας στο μονοπάτι σαν γαμήλια άμαξα του θανάτου, όλο κόκαλο μυς συντονισμός, οι οπλές του χτυπώντας στην πέτρα, κλοπ θουντ κλοπ, ρυθμός ανώμαλος, το ζώο να προστατεύει το αριστερό του μπροστινό πόδι. Ένα μάτι είχε, η αριστερή κόγχη άδεια, καταρρεύσει προς τα μέσα, ένας κρατήρας. Το μάτι που απέμεινε κυλούσε, τεράστιο σαν βραστό αβγό, να επιθεωρεί τον κόσμο.

Ο Γκάνταλφ καθόταν πάνω του, το γένι του να κατρακυλά, ο καταρράκτης των μαλλιών του να έχει γίνει άγριος και λευκός σαν νερό πλυσίματος, οι ρόμπες του να φτερουγίζουν.

«Σαμ,» σύριξα, «ο Γκάνταλφ είναι έξω.»

«Γκάνταλφ;» Το κεφάλι του Σαμ γύρισε απότομα, το τσάι του να χύνεται. «Ο μάγος Γκάνταλφ; Εδώ; Τώρα;»

Σκοντάψαμε προς τα έξω, το άλογο σταμάτησε. Ανέπνεε βαριά, τα ρουθούνια του να φουσκώνουν, η ανάσα του να ατμίζει στον αέρα, που δεν έπρεπε να είναι κρύος αλλά ήταν ούτως ή άλλως.

Κατέβηκε, το άλογο φύσηξε, εκείνο το μοναδικό μάτι να κυλά.

«Ποιο φαίνεται να είναι το πρόβλημα, Φρόντο;» ο Γκάνταλφ πλησίασε.

«Το δαχτυλίδι μου,» άρχισα. «Το αγόρασα από το Μαγαζί του Ανιψιού του Μπίλμπο, δίπλα στο τμήμα των ξωτικών χτενών, ξέρεις το μέρος; Πουλάνε δαχτυλίδια αοράτου, νόμιμα...»

«Νόμιμα,» φύσηξε ο Γκάνταλφ, ο ήχος σαν φύσημα αλόγου, περιφρονητικός, αρχαίος.

«...με ετικέτες προειδοποίησης! Επαγγελματικές ετικέτες προειδοποίησης! 'Χρησιμοποιήστε αυτό το δαχτυλίδι μόνο αν δεν σέβεστε χρόνο, χώρο.'»

«Και;» Ο Γκάνταλφ στηρίχτηκε στο ραβδί του, το βάρος να μετατοπίζεται, περιμένοντας.

«Και δυσλειτουργεί! Χθες τα πόδια μου περπάτησαν ξεχωριστά από τον κορμό μου. Σήμερα το πρωί; Σήμερα το πρωί, Γκάνταλφ, έκλεισα τα μάτια και το αριστερό μου χέρι εξαφανίστηκε για έξι λεπτά. Έξι! Ξέρεις πόσο δύσκολο είναι να βουτυρώνεις φρυγανιά με ένα χέρι όταν το χέρι που λείπει είναι το κυρίαρχο;»

Το γένι του Γκάνταλφ τινάχτηκε, μπορεί να ήταν χαμόγελο, μπορεί να ήταν αηδία. «Τηλεφώνησες στον κατασκευαστή.»

Όχι ερώτηση. Δήλωση. Το ήξερε.

«Μόρντορ Βιομηχανίες. Μίλησα με τον ίδιο τον Σάουρον. Μου ανακοίνωσε...» Έφτυσα τις λέξεις, γεμάτες δηλητήριο, βουτηγμένες σε μανία, «...ότι εγώ έχω το δαχτυλίδι αλλά νοικιάζω την αοράτου. Ότι η μαγεία μέσα ανήκει σε αυτούς. Για πάντα. Διαρκώς. Ότι μπορούν να την απενεργοποιήσουν από απόσταση αν παραβιάσω τους όρους χρήσης που δεν διάβασα γιατί ποιος διαβάζει όρους χρήσης;»

«Όλοι θα έπρεπε,» μουρμούρισε ο Γκάνταλφ, «αλλά κανείς δεν το κάνει. Ιστορία παλιά όσο ο χρόνος, αυτή.»

Ο Σαμ πετάχτηκε, φωνή ποντικού που τρίζει, «Είναι έξω φρενών, Γκάνταλφ. Κυριολεκτικά λυμένος. Έχει πιει το μανιταρένιο τσάι μου και στροβιλίζεται για ιδιοκτησία έναντι κατοχής και...»

«Τι λες εσύ, Γκάνταλφ;» ρώτησα, «Γιατί καβαλάς αυτό το κυκλωπικό βδέλυγμα αντί να οδηγείς κάτι λογικό;»

Το άλογο φύσηξε πάλι, πιθανόν προσβεβλημένο, εκείνο το μοναδικό μάτι να στενεύει.

«Ενημέρωση,» βρυχήθηκε ο Γκάνταλφ, η λέξη κομμένη απότομα. «Ενημέρωση λογισμικού. Αυτόματη ενημέρωση λογισμικού εγκαταστάθηκε μόνη της τη νύχτα ενώ το όχημά μου καθόταν να φορτίζει. Μεσάνυχτα. Χωρίς προειδοποίηση. Χωρίς συγκατάθεση. Απλά πινγκ, 'Ενημέρωση διαθέσιμη, εγκαθίσταται τώρα, μην αποσυνδέσετε το ρεύμα, αυτό θα πάρει δεκαπέντε λεπτά.'»

«Δεκαπέντε λεπτά;» ρώτησε ο Σαμ.

«Δεκαεπτά ώρες,» βρυχήθηκε ο Γκάνταλφ, το ραβδί να χτυπά το έδαφος, σπίθες να πετούν, πραγματικές σπίθες, μικρές φωτιές να πεθαίνουν γρήγορα. «Δεκαεπτά ώρες 'Βελτιστοποίηση απόδοσης συστήματος, παρακαλώ περιμένετε.' Ήρθε το πρωί. Ανέτειλε ο ήλιος, τα πουλιά τραγούδησαν τα ηλίθια τραγούδια τους. Το αυτοκίνητο ακόμα βελτιστοποιούσε. Ακόμα περίμενε. Έψαξα στα φόρουμ...»

«Φόρουμ;» Ανοιγόκλεισα τα μάτια.

«Φόρουμ μάγων. Τεχνική υποστήριξη για μαγικά κλιμένους. Προφανώς αυτή η ενημέρωση, έκδοση 7.4.2, τουβλώνει οχήματα κατασκευασμένα πριν το Έτος της Στραμμένης Σελήνης. Τα τουβλώνει. Τα ακινητοποιεί εντελώς. Δεν ξεκινούν. Δεν φορτίζουν. Απλά κάθονται εκεί, διακόσμηση αυλόγυρου.»

«Οπότε καβαλάς...» έδειξα προς το άλογο.

«Μάγκνους,» είπε ο Γκάνταλφ. «Το όνομά του είναι Μάγκνους. Μονόφθαλμο λευκό άλογο. Χρειαζόμουν μεταφορά, εκείνος χρειαζόταν σκοπό.»

Ο Μάγκνους χτύπησε οπλή, το μοναδικό μάτι να καρφώνεται πάνω μου, η κόρη του να διαστέλλεται, να συστέλλεται, ανησυχητικός υπνωτιστικός ρυθμός.

«Πόσος καιρός μέχρι να φτιαχτεί το αυτοκίνητό σου;» τόλμησε ο Σαμ.

«Η τεχνική υποστήριξη λέει διόρθωση την επόμενη εβδομάδα. Ίσως. Πιθανόν. 'Σύντομα.' Ξέρεις πώς πάνε αυτά τα πράγματα. Στο μεταξύ, καβαλάω τον Μάγκνους. Δένουμε. Με ανέχεται. Τώρα. Για το δαχτυλίδι σου. Άσε με να το δω.»

Τράβηξα το δαχτυλίδι από την τσέπη, το κράτησα απέξω, το μέταλλο να πιάνει το φως λάθος, να το λυγίζει, να το παραμορφώνει, η πραγματικότητα να κυματίζει γύρω από την περιφέρεια.

Ο Γκάνταλφ το πήρε, το κράτησε κοντά, το ένα μάτι να μισοκλείνει, το άλλο μάτι να μισοκλείνει διαφορετικά, να εξετάζει, να ψάχνει, να μουρμουρίζει λέξεις που δεν αναγνώριζα, πιθανόν δεν θα έπρεπε να αναγνωρίσω.

«Μμμ,» είπε τελικά. «Ναι. Σίγουρα φτηνό. Σίγουρα καταραμένο. Σίγουρα παραβιάζει περίπου επτακόσιους κανονισμούς σχετικά με διαστατικό χειρισμό. Είσαι τυχερός που δεν έχεις περάσει ακόμα φάση μέσα από τον πυρήνα του πλανήτη.»

«Μπορείς να το φτιάξεις;»

Πέταξε το δαχτυλίδι πίσω. Το έπιασα, το μασκάρεψα, παραλίγο να το ρίξω.

«Όχι, Φρόντο. Δεν μπορώ να το φτιάξω. Κανείς δεν μπορεί να το φτιάξει χωρίς το ίχνος εκτέλεσης, γιατί το φτιάξιμο κοστίζει μόνο τα ανταλλακτικά και το να σου πουλήσουν νέο μοντέλο κάνει περισσότερα χρήματα. Απλά οικονομικά. Παλιά όσο οι δράκοι που θησαυρίζουν χρυσάφι. Παλαιότερα.»

Ο Μάγκνους χλιμίντρισε, πιθανόν σύμφωνα, ή από πείνα. Δύσκολο να πεις με μονόφθαλμα άλογα.

Ο Σαμ μουρμούρισε κάτι για «όχι αυτό πάλι» και υποχώρησε στο κελάρι.
* 1 # Κεφάλαιο 1: Η διάβαση της γέφυρας

1.1.1 Τα δέντρα, εκείνα τα λυγισμένα νεύρα από φλοιό, κουνιόνταν στο βλέμμα μου, οι ρίζες ξύνοντας το χώμα, οι κορμοί σκυμμένοι προς τα μέσα σαν το χαμόγελο μιας γοργόνας, τα στραβά κλαδιά τους χτυπώντας τη γη σε μια παρωδία χαιρετισμού.

1.3.1 Βάδισα βαριά μέσα από το μονοπάτι, σε μια στενή σήραγγα από αγκάθια, τα καλάμια τους τυλιγμένα σαν το ακτένιστο μουστάκι κάποιου αρχαίου σκαντζόχοιρου που έδειχνε τις αγκαθωτές του ακίδες.

1.5.2 Όχι η συνηθισμένη υγρή χνουδωτή ομίχλη του Σάιρ αλλά ένα υγρό, κρεατώδες πράγμα που κολλάει στο λαιμό μου και ψιθυρίζει με τους νεκρούς τόνους ενός πνιγμένου εκκλησιαστικού οργανίστα.

1.9.1 Στη μέση της διάβασης, πάτησα σε μια ακόμη σανίδα, ή αυτό που περνούσε για σανίδα, ένα μόνο κόκαλο από ένα ζώο, που ίσως να μην ήταν και το πιο έξυπνο να σφαγεί.

1.9.1 Στη μέση της διάβασης, πάτησα σε άλλη μια σανίδα, ή αυτό που περνούσε για σανίδα, ένα μόνο κόκαλο από ένα ζώο, που ίσως να μην ήταν σοφό να το σφάξουν.

1.15.2 Σκόνταψα μπροστά, πιάστηκα από τα υπόλοιπα σχοινιά της γέφυρας, αυτά τα νεύρα που ακόμα κρατούσαν τον σκοπό τους.

* # Κεφάλαιο 5: Ο Γκάνταλφ και το άλογό του

Το παράθυρο, λερωμένο πράγμα που ήταν, μου έδειξε κίνηση, και ο κρότος οπλών σε χαλίκι ανήγγειλε μια μορφή να πλησιάζει.

Ένα άλογο, λευκό, μονόφθαλμο, ήρθε καλπάζοντας στο μονοπάτι σαν γαμήλια άμαξα του θανάτου, όλο κόκαλο μυς συντονισμός, οι οπλές του χτυπώντας στην πέτρα, κλοπ θουντ κλοπ, ρυθμός ανώμαλος, το ζώο να προστατεύει το αριστερό του μπροστινό πόδι. Ένα μάτι είχε, η αριστερή κόγχη άδεια, καταρρεύσει προς τα μέσα, ένας κρατήρας. Το μάτι που απέμεινε κυλούσε, τεράστιο σαν βραστό αβγό, να επιθεωρεί τον κόσμο.

Ο Γκάνταλφ καθόταν πάνω του, το γένι του να κατρακυλά, ο καταρράκτης των μαλλιών του να έχει γίνει άγριος και λευκός σαν νερό πλυσίματος, οι ρόμπες του να φτερουγίζουν.

«Σαμ,» σύριξα, «ο Γκάνταλφ είναι έξω.»

«Γκάνταλφ;» Το κεφάλι του Σαμ γύρισε απότομα, το τσάι του να χύνεται. «Ο μάγος Γκάνταλφ; Εδώ; Τώρα;»

Σκοντάψαμε προς τα έξω, το άλογο σταμάτησε. Ανέπνεε βαριά, τα ρουθούνια του να φουσκώνουν, η ανάσα του να ατμίζει στον αέρα, που δεν έπρεπε να είναι κρύος αλλά ήταν ούτως ή άλλως.

Κατέβηκε, το άλογο φύσηξε, εκείνο το μοναδικό μάτι να κυλά.

«Ποιο φαίνεται να είναι το πρόβλημα, Φρόντο;» ο Γκάνταλφ πλησίασε.

«Το δαχτυλίδι μου,» άρχισα. «Το αγόρασα από το Μαγαζί του Ανιψιού του Μπίλμπο, δίπλα στο τμήμα των ξωτικών χτενών, ξέρεις το μέρος; Πουλάνε δαχτυλίδια αοράτου, νόμιμα...»

«Νόμιμα,» φύσηξε ο Γκάνταλφ, ο ήχος σαν φύσημα αλόγου, περιφρονητικός, αρχαίος.

«...με ετικέτες προειδοποίησης! Επαγγελματικές ετικέτες προειδοποίησης! 'Χρησιμοποιήστε αυτό το δαχτυλίδι μόνο αν δεν σέβεστε χρόνο, χώρο.'»

«Και;» Ο Γκάνταλφ στηρίχτηκε στο ραβδί του, το βάρος να μετατοπίζεται, περιμένοντας.

«Και δυσλειτουργεί! Χθες τα πόδια μου περπάτησαν ξεχωριστά από τον κορμό μου. Σήμερα το πρωί; Σήμερα το πρωί, Γκάνταλφ, έκλεισα τα μάτια και το αριστερό μου χέρι εξαφανίστηκε για έξι λεπτά. Έξι! Ξέρεις πόσο δύσκολο είναι να βουτυρώνεις φρυγανιά με ένα χέρι όταν το χέρι που λείπει είναι το κυρίαρχο;»

Το γένι του Γκάνταλφ τινάχτηκε, μπορεί να ήταν χαμόγελο, μπορεί να ήταν αηδία. «Τηλεφώνησες στον κατασκευαστή.»

Όχι ερώτηση. Δήλωση. Το ήξερε.

«Μόρντορ Βιομηχανίες. Μίλησα με τον ίδιο τον Σάουρον. Μου ανακοίνωσε...» Έφτυσα τις λέξεις, γεμάτες δηλητήριο, βουτηγμένες σε μανία, «...ότι εγώ έχω το δαχτυλίδι αλλά νοικιάζω την αοράτου. Ότι η μαγεία μέσα ανήκει σε αυτούς. Για πάντα. Διαρκώς. Ότι μπορούν να την απενεργοποιήσουν από απόσταση αν παραβιάσω τους όρους χρήσης που δεν διάβασα γιατί ποιος διαβάζει όρους χρήσης;»

«Όλοι θα έπρεπε,» μουρμούρισε ο Γκάνταλφ, «αλλά κανείς δεν το κάνει. Ιστορία παλιά όσο ο χρόνος, αυτή.»

Ο Σαμ πετάχτηκε, φωνή ποντικού που τρίζει, «Είναι έξω φρενών, Γκάνταλφ. Κυριολεκτικά λυμένος. Έχει πιει το μανιταρένιο τσάι μου και στροβιλίζεται για ιδιοκτησία έναντι κατοχής και...»

«Τι λες εσύ, Γκάνταλφ;» ρώτησα, «Γιατί καβαλάς αυτό το κυκλωπικό βδέλυγμα αντί να οδηγείς κάτι λογικό;»

Το άλογο φύσηξε πάλι, πιθανόν προσβεβλημένο, εκείνο το μοναδικό μάτι να στενεύει.

«Ενημέρωση,» βρυχήθηκε ο Γκάνταλφ, η λέξη κομμένη απότομα. «Ενημέρωση λογισμικού. Αυτόματη ενημέρωση λογισμικού εγκαταστάθηκε μόνη της τη νύχτα ενώ το όχημά μου καθόταν να φορτίζει. Μεσάνυχτα. Χωρίς προειδοποίηση. Χωρίς συγκατάθεση. Απλά πινγκ, 'Ενημέρωση διαθέσιμη, εγκαθίσταται τώρα, μην αποσυνδέσετε το ρεύμα, αυτό θα πάρει δεκαπέντε λεπτά.'»

«Δεκαπέντε λεπτά;» ρώτησε ο Σαμ.

«Δεκαεπτά ώρες,» βρυχήθηκε ο Γκάνταλφ, το ραβδί να χτυπά το έδαφος, σπίθες να πετούν, πραγματικές σπίθες, μικρές φωτιές να πεθαίνουν γρήγορα. «Δεκαεπτά ώρες 'Βελτιστοποίηση απόδοσης συστήματος, παρακαλώ περιμένετε.' Ήρθε το πρωί. Ανέτειλε ο ήλιος, τα πουλιά τραγούδησαν τα ηλίθια τραγούδια τους. Το αυτοκίνητο ακόμα βελτιστοποιούσε. Ακόμα περίμενε. Έψαξα στα φόρουμ...»

«Φόρουμ;» Ανοιγόκλεισα τα μάτια.

«Φόρουμ μάγων. Τεχνική υποστήριξη για μαγικά κλιμένους. Προφανώς αυτή η ενημέρωση, έκδοση 7.4.2, τουβλώνει οχήματα κατασκευασμένα πριν το Έτος της Στραμμένης Σελήνης. Τα τουβλώνει. Τα ακινητοποιεί εντελώς. Δεν ξεκινούν. Δεν φορτίζουν. Απλά κάθονται εκεί, διακόσμηση αυλόγυρου.»

«Οπότε καβαλάς...» έδειξα προς το άλογο.

«Μάγκνους,» είπε ο Γκάνταλφ. «Το όνομά του είναι Μάγκνους. Μονόφθαλμο λευκό άλογο. Χρειαζόμουν μεταφορά, εκείνος χρειαζόταν σκοπό.»

Ο Μάγκνους χτύπησε οπλή, το μοναδικό μάτι να καρφώνεται πάνω μου, η κόρη του να διαστέλλεται, να συστέλλεται, ανησυχητικός υπνωτιστικός ρυθμός.

«Πόσος καιρός μέχρι να φτιαχτεί το αυτοκίνητό σου;» τόλμησε ο Σαμ.

«Η τεχνική υποστήριξη λέει διόρθωση την επόμενη εβδομάδα. Ίσως. Πιθανόν. 'Σύντομα.' Ξέρεις πώς πάνε αυτά τα πράγματα. Στο μεταξύ, καβαλάω τον Μάγκνους. Δένουμε. Με ανέχεται. Τώρα. Για το δαχτυλίδι σου. Άσε με να το δω.»

Τράβηξα το δαχτυλίδι από την τσέπη, το κράτησα απέξω, το μέταλλο να πιάνει το φως λάθος, να το λυγίζει, να το παραμορφώνει, η πραγματικότητα να κυματίζει γύρω από την περιφέρεια.

Ο Γκάνταλφ το πήρε, το κράτησε κοντά, το ένα μάτι να μισοκλείνει, το άλλο μάτι να μισοκλείνει διαφορετικά, να εξετάζει, να ψάχνει, να μουρμουρίζει λέξεις που δεν αναγνώριζα, πιθανόν δεν θα έπρεπε να αναγνωρίσω.

«Μμμ,» είπε τελικά. «Ναι. Σίγουρα φτηνό. Σίγουρα καταραμένο. Σίγουρα παραβιάζει περίπου επτακόσιους κανονισμούς σχετικά με διαστατικό χειρισμό. Είσαι τυχερός που δεν έχεις περάσει ακόμα φάση μέσα από τον πυρήνα του πλανήτη.»

«Μπορείς να το φτιάξεις;»

Πέταξε το δαχτυλίδι πίσω. Το έπιασα, το μασκάρεψα, παραλίγο να το ρίξω.

«Όχι, Φρόντο. Δεν μπορώ να το φτιάξω. Κανείς δεν μπορεί να το φτιάξει χωρίς το ίχνος εκτέλεσης, γιατί το φτιάξιμο κοστίζει μόνο τα ανταλλακτικά και το να σου πουλήσουν νέο μοντέλο κάνει περισσότερα χρήματα. Απλά οικονομικά. Παλιά όσο οι δράκοι που θησαυρίζουν χρυσάφι. Παλαιότερα.»

Ο Μάγκνους χλιμίντρισε, πιθανόν σύμφωνα, ή από πείνα. Δύσκολο να πεις με μονόφθαλμα άλογα.

Ο Σαμ μουρμούρισε κάτι για «όχι αυτό πάλι» και υποχώρησε στο κελάρι.
